For Stephen A. Feinberg, the long road back from the most disastrous investment of his career — Chrysler L.L.C. — began last week around a polished wood table inside the Treasury Department.

It was not the road he had envisioned when his private investment firm, Cerberus Capital Management, bought Chrysler in the summer of 2007.

Back then, Mr. Feinberg was hailed as a hero — the Wall Street financier who just might save the American car industry. Instead, he lost billions for his investors and co-investors. And last week it became clear that he would lose Chrysler’s auto operations, as well.

So as the Obama administration prepared to assert control over Chrysler and General Motors, Mr. Feinberg flew to Washington to try to salvage what he could. In a midweek meeting with Treasury officials, Mr. Feinberg agreed to give up the 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler held by Cerberus and its co-investors, according to a person briefed on the negotiations. He first offered to do this last year.

But Mr. Feinberg did not go quietly. He also discussed additional federal money to help his other wayward investments in Detroit: GMAC and Chrysler Financial. Cerberus is now pushing the government to help orchestrate a merger of the two auto financing companies — a move that might eventually yield a profit for Cerberus.

Whether the Obama administration will oblige is unclear. But this much is certain: Cerberus, long considered one of the most formidable investment firms on Wall Street and in Washington, stumbled badly in Detroit. It is now struggling to rescue not only what it can of its investments — about $3 billion in Chrysler and the two finance companies — but also its reputation. Cerberus persuaded others on Wall Street to invest billions more.

Cerberus, many agree, was like so many private equity firms that overreached during the late boom in corporate buyouts. But the firm also seems to have miscalculated in Washington. Mr. Feinberg employs a Who’s Who of Washington insiders, among them John W. Snow, the former Treasury secretary, and Dan Quayle, a former vice president. Cerberus has lobbied aggressively in recent months to shape the government’s rescue of the auto industry, to little avail.

“There was a certain degree of hubris here,” said John Gabbert, the chief executive of PitchBook, a firm that researches private equity.

Its daring deal for Chrysler vaulted Cerberus, then virtually unknown outside financial circles, to prominence. But now Cerberus — and its investors — are paying the price.

Cerberus persuaded some of the most prominent names in the financial world to join it in its Chrysler and GMAC investments. Its co-investors in those include the investment arm of Abu Dhabi as well as hedge funds like York Capital. Some hedge funds, like Eton Park, invested only in GMAC, but they, too, are feeling the pain.

Those co-investors have taken four times the losses in aggregate as Cerberus, and many have already written their stakes down to zero, or pennies on the dollar. A few of them, though, doubled down on GMAC in December, counting on Cerberus to find a way out of the wreck.

A former trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert the junk bond powerhouse of the 1980s, Mr. Feinberg rose from relative obscurity on Wall Street after a decade trading mostly in bonds.

But Cerberus, like many private equity firms, loaded its new ward with what turned out to be crippling amounts of debt. Cerberus piled about $20 billion of debt onto Chrysler, Mr. Gabbert said. As car sales plunged across the industry — and, in particular, at Chrysler — the carmaker began to buckle under its load.

“It seems like Chrysler would be in extreme difficulty whether Cerberus had showed up or not,” said Josh Lerner, a professor at the Harvard Business School who has studied private equity.

A few weeks ago, Cerberus began telling its co-investors that it was likely to give up control of Chrysler’s auto unit, according to a co-investor and also the person briefed on Mr. Feinberg’s meeting. The co-investors had agreed from the start that Cerberus could give away their stakes along with its own and that Cerberus could make virtually all of the decisions related to Chrysler and GMAC.

Cerberus put in only about one-fifth of the capital for Chrysler and GMAC, limiting its financial downside, but it was in charge of appointing new management teams and establishing Chrysler’s overall strategy.

Cerberus began losing its control over its Detroit investments when the government stepped in to rescue the automakers last year. In the case of GMAC, the government invested money in December and required that most of Cerberus’s operations team be removed. But some co-investors said that made sense because at that time, the government became the majority owner of GMAC.
