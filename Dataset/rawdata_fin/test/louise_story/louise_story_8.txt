A longtime director at Bank of America resigned on Friday, the latest in a series of changes on the company’s board.

O. Temple Sloan, 70, had served on the bank’s board for 13 years, much of it as the lead director, giving him influence second only to the chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis. In recent months, Mr. Sloan, a strong ally of Mr. Lewis’s, had become the focus of shareholder complaints over the bank’s merger with Merrill Lynch.

Mr. Sloan lost some of his power after the bank’s annual meeting last month, when shareholders voted to appoint an independent chairman, stripping Mr. Lewis of that title. The board chose a director other than Mr. Sloan to become chairman. Soon afterward, the new chairman, Walter E. Massey, created a committee to review board activities; Mr. Sloan was not named to the panel.

Some shareholder groups that have been critical of the bank responded favorably to Mr. Sloan’s resignation.

“As the lead independent director, he bears primary responsibility for the board’s failure to independently oversee management,” said Michael Garland, a spokesman for the CtW Investment Group, which helps invest union pension funds.

Mr. Sloan is the second longtime director to leave. Meredith Spangler, a large shareholder who had been a director for two decades, retired this spring. Both Ms. Spangler and Mr. Sloan were supporters of Mr. Lewis, who said in a statement that he would miss Mr. Sloan.

“Temple has been a trusted adviser who has made an invaluable contribution to the success of our company," Mr. Lewis said.

More changes could occur. When the government released the bank’s stress test, Mr. Massey said he was reviewing the makeup of the board to ensure its members had enough financial expertise.
