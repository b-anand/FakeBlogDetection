Jed S. Rakoff, a United States District Court judge in Manhattan, is not one to rubber-stamp administrative decisions.

Known as a maverick in legal circles, Judge Rakoff has in the past found the death penalty illegal, inserted himself into corporate governance reform at WorldCom, and pushed for the release of documents in private settlements.

Now he is tussling with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Bank of America, which will both file reports to him Monday detailing who knew what about $3.6 billion in bonuses paid out by Merrill Lynch just before Bank of America took it over last year.

The Merrill payouts have been at the center of hearings in Congress as well as an investigation by the New York attorney general. But Judge Rakoff is the first to demand that Bank of America reveal who decided not to disclose the bonuses to shareholders before the merger with Merrill closed.

In an interview last week, shortly after he rejected a settlement between the agency and the bank that was meant to put the matter to rest, he remembered a time when executives were held more directly accountable for actions taken by their companies.

Decades ago, when he began his career in the securities fraud unit of the Southern District of New York, prosecutors placed greater accountability on individual executives at companies, he recalled. Charges tended to be filed mostly against those people, rather than against the corporation.

“The feeling then,” he said, “was if a crime had been committed, it was important to discover who the persons were who made the wrongful decisions.”

Now Judge Rakoff is raising questions about executives at Bank of America, as well as the S.E.C.’s logic in imposing a $33 million fine on the bank. At a hearing Aug. 11, he said it appeared the bank had “effectively lied to its shareholders” about Merrill’s bonuses, which he said had been paid by American taxpayers, since the bank received a second bailout shortly afterward.

And besides, he wanted to know, shouldn’t a much higher fine be imposed directly on “the individuals who were responsible” for the mess?

It is not the first time Judge Rakoff has ruffled feathers in the business world. In 2003, for example, he refused to approve what he saw as a low settlement the S.E.C. had negotiated with WorldCom, the phone company that collapsed in an $11 billion accounting fraud.

Lawyers said Judge Rakoff is known for his push for transparency, which he believes is needed for the courts to keep the public’s confidence. For instance, he has some of the strictest rules limiting what sorts of material in cases before him may be kept confidential, said Gregory Diskant, a lawyer who worked with Judge Rakoff in the 1970s, when they were both federal prosecutors. (Judge Rakoff also recently ruled in favor of The New York Times in a freedom of information act case.)

“Everything needs to be public,” the judge said. “The legitimacy of the courts comes from the fact that they reason openly, on the record, based on facts.”

The facts, of course, have been particularly elusive in Bank of America’s merger with Merrill Lynch. Even after a series of hearings before Congress, and an investigation by the New York attorney general, it remains unclear who at the bank knew what about Merrill’s bonuses or its mounting losses on the eve of the merger. The judge will release the bank’s and commission’s filings on Monday.

At the heart of Judge Rakoff’s inquiry is a question of blame. The S.E.C.’s complaint against Bank of America made no charges against individuals, meaning that the fine the agency imposed would be paid by the bank’s shareholders — the very people who were allegedly harmed by the bank’s secrecy.

Rewarding — and punishing — the right parties was at the fore of Judge Rakoff’s thinking in the WorldCom case six years ago. Shareholders of that company had already lost out. So when the judge forced the S.E.C. to increase the $500 million fine it was levying against the firm to $750 million, he also demanded that the money be paid out to the company’s shareholders, rather than to the agency.

But he also decided not to make the fine too high.

“I could have put the company out of business,” he acknowledged. “But it seemed to me that would have been 60,000 jobs needlessly lost.”

To put the company on a healthier track, he then oversaw a review of WorldCom’s corporate governance practices.

It is the kind of intervention that would make many a spine shiver on Wall Street, where banks have generally tried to keep the government out of their business even as they have accepted bailout money.

When asked if he is anti-Wall Street, however, Judge Rakoff sat straight up. “The plaintiffs bar sometimes thinks I’m pro,” he said, adding that he had dismissed a number of shareholder cases against companies for lack of evidence.

Changing the subject, he rose and walked to a corner of his office, where he pointed to a photo montage from the court’s annual Courthouse Follies. There stood three singing hobos, judges all, performing a song written by Judge Rakoff. One of his singing partners had a familiar look — it was Sonia Sotomayor, the recently appointed Supreme Court justice. She wore a red bandanna, while Judge Rakoff sported a fake black tooth and smudges on his cheeks.

“I have a past of making a fool of myself,” he said, chuckling.

He also presented a visitor with a copy of a mock legal opinion he recently wrote — this one in favor of a banker. The ruling, written partly as a poem, was based on “The Merchant of Venice” by Shakespeare. Judge Rakoff ruled that Shylock, the Venetian money lender, should win his appeal to receive some recompense from Antonio, a borrower — even if it wasn’t a pound of flesh.

The judge declined to discuss his plans for Bank of America, but lawyers said the judge might hold another hearing with both sides after receiving the filings and responses he has requested. If he does not approve the settlement, the S.E.C. could choose to drop the case, renegotiate the settlement or take Bank of America to court.

In the meantime, Wall Street could be in for a bit more blunt talk from the bench.

“The S.E.C. has to have noticed by now that most of the country agrees with the sentiments expressed by Rakoff,” said John C. Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor who has taught a course along with Judge Rakoff for 21 years. “This builds up pressure on Bank of America and the S.E.C.”
