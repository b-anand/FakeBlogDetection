 For months, Bank of America has been trying to keep secret its legal conversations at the end of last year about its coming merger with Merrill Lynch. So far, it has succeeded, mainly by arguing that those conversations should remain confidential because they are protected by attorney-client privilege.

But now, the bank is facing questions from a House panel, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose chairman, Representative Edolphus Towns, has told the bank that it cannot use attorney-client privilege when dealing with Congress.

If Mr. Towns has his way, Bank of America would be forced to reveal information that would then affect a range of other investigations into the merger, including one by the attorney general of New York and another by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In a sternly worded letter on Friday, Mr. Towns, a New York Democrat, said the bank must divulge when it became aware of the enormous losses at Merrill last year, when it received a commitment from the federal government for a second round of bailout money and what legal advice its management received about whether it had to disclose those developments to the bank's shareholders.

Mr. Towns gave the bank until noon on Monday to provide answers and relevant legal documents. He said it seemed that the bank was ''hiding information.'' The bank replied to Mr. Towns's committee late on Saturday, asking him to delay that request until after Tuesday, when Mr. Towns meets with Anne Finucane, the bank's chief strategy and marketing officer, who oversees public policy at the bank. But a spokesman for Mr. Towns said on Sunday that he was sticking to the deadline.

''We appreciate and take very seriously the committee's important oversight role and have nothing but the strongest intent to work with the committee to help it understand these events,'' Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's chief executive, said in a letter to Mr. Towns.

The move sets up a showdown that will be widely watched in both Washington and on Wall Street. Bank of America is trying to defuse the issue with the help of some high-powered lobbyists. It recently hired the Podesta Group, run by Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic lobbyist, to contact Mr. Towns's staff.

The inquiry by the House panel is just one of many tussles involving the bank's merger with Merrill Lynch, and the bank noted in its reply to Mr. Towns's committee that any steps it takes before Congress could affect the other investigations. In particular, the bank said, if it voluntarily provides Congress with the legal advice that it received related to the merger, then it might waive the right to keep its legal advice private in its case before the S.E.C., which is scheduled to go to trial in February. The merger is also being examined by Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York.

''What makes it complicated is it's not just two parties, it's not just three parties, it's six or seven parties,'' said David Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who is overseeing the S.E.C. case. ''It's like a multiplayer chess game where each party is making different moves from a different strategic position and each party has a huge amount at stake.''

There is also a maze of issues underlying the investigations. While the S.E.C. case focused only on the bonuses paid out at Merrill before the merger, Mr. Towns and Mr. Cuomo are looking at surprise losses at Merrill as well as Bank of America's suggestion that it considered backing out of the deal last year as a result of the losses. Mr. Towns instructed the bank to tell its current and former employees that they should not assert attorney-client privilege when they are interviewed by his committee.
