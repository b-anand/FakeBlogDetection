The swarm of legal and political troubles that prompted Mr. Lewis to resign from his post atop Bank of America on Wednesday are likely to follow him long after he leaves. Indeed, new ones are already on the way.

Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, is considering charging Mr. Lewis with civil fraud as early as next week on the grounds of failing to disclose crucial information about the bank’s merger with Merrill Lynch to shareholders, according to a person familiar with Mr. Cuomo’s plans. The attorney general has been examining why details of Merrill’s bonuses, losses, write-downs, and the consideration that Bank of America executives gave to canceling the merger at the last minute, were not revealed.

The inquiry is one of several investigations that are set to intensify in coming weeks over the bank’s purchase of Merrill Lynch, and the role that Mr. Lewis and other executives played in not disclosing the losses and bonus payouts. The inquiries, which have multiplied as the attorney general of Ohio and several lawmakers sought answers, led Mr. Lewis to a growing recognition that they were becoming an issue for the company, said a person familiar with Mr. Lewis’s reasoning for retiring.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is also preparing a case that will be tried in federal court in the next few months, claiming that the bank had violated federal securities laws by not informing shareholders of the bonuses paid by Merrill to employees. The action comes after Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court in New York rejected what he viewed as a contrived settlement between the two that had allowed Bank of America to avoid naming specific executives and lawyers who knew of the bonuses and were responsible for disclosure decisions.

The disclosure issue has also become a political lightning rod for Bank of America, which is trying to repay $45 billion in taxpayer support. Lawmakers have been seeking similar information from the bank, and from Mr. Lewis, who has already testified on Capitol Hill about the matter. Leaders of the Congressional committee that is interested in the merger said in interviews that their scrutiny would remain strong after Mr. Lewis left.

“This matter is not closed — the investigation has to continue,” said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio. “He became the face of a system that was suddenly exposed as not being as adept and forthcoming as people would expect.”

On Tuesday, the bank is due to provide a log of documents to Representative Edolphus Towns, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The bank is arguing that it should be allowed to keep those documents confidential.

Bank of America will continue to pay Mr. Lewis’s legal bills after he retires, Robert Stickler, a spokesman, said. Mr. Lewis recently hired a lawyer, Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton in New York, to handle his case. The bank is using a lawyer at another firm, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.

“Our company continues to try to cooperate with the various investigations in a very difficult environment,” Mr. Stickler said.

The bank has said that it did not mislead investors in the disclosure that it made about the merger with Merrill Lynch, and claimed it should not be forced to reveal the legal advice that it received just before shareholders approved the deal on Dec. 5.

As long as Mr. Lewis is chief executive of the bank, he can influence decisions on what it turns over. But when he departs, his power dims.

Companies often claim that their legal advice should be kept private. But that privilege applies only to the company that hired the lawyers, not its executives, said Jill E. Fisch, a corporate law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. That means that Mr. Lewis would not be able to block lawyers from revealing information if the bank decided to let them open up.

The bank’s board has increased its involvement in the investigations in recent meetings, according to two people briefed on the board’s thinking. The directors have studied “what if” prospects around each inquiry into the bank and tried to analyze what to do if other investigations emerge later on. One outcome involves charges filed against an executive of the bank, one of these people said.

Mr. Lewis is also a member of the board, and he has been present during those discussions.

On a business tour of Asia in recent weeks, Mr. Lewis spent time thinking about his legacy and discussing it with others, said a person familiar with the matter. The Merrill merger, which seemed ideal until it soured, will probably become his final chapter, Mr. Lewis acknowledged then, the person said.

Mr. Lewis leaves before it is clear whether his bet on Merrill and other deals in recent years were worthwhile. Merrill units have been turning profits, but the political and public fallout may not have been worth it, analysts said. And for the hard-charging bank chief, the image of the Wall Street king who reached too far even while taking bailout money will be hard to erase.

“This man has a major stain on him,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. “I’ve known him for decades, and what was painful is he’s actually a decent guy.”

The challenges come as the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., strives to assure regulators that it will remain on sound financial footing. The bank is still in the bailout ranks, and it will not be free to pay its workers as it sees fit until it repays at least some of that aid.

“This is a difficult environment, and I’d like to see the company move past the investigations,” said Jonathan Finger, a bank shareholder who is suing over the merger. “They’re a distraction. They hang over the company. The fact that he’s resigning is an important first step.”

This month, Mr. Lewis began telling confidants that he may have lost hope of escaping from the taint of the deal, said two people who have spoken with him.

And, they said, he told them that he wanted nothing more than for the bank to move on.
