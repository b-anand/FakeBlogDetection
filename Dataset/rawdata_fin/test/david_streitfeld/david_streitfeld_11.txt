U.S. book publishers and booksellers are full of foreboding - even more than usual for an industry that has been anticipating its demise since the advent of television. The holiday season that just ended is likely to have been one of the worst in decades. Publishers have been cutting back and laying off. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt announced that it would not acquire any new manuscripts, a move akin to a butcher shop proclaiming it had stopped ordering fresh meat.

American bookstores, both new and secondhand, are faltering as well.

Olsson's, the leading independent chain in Washington, went bankrupt and shut down in September. Robin's, which says it is the oldest bookstore in Philadelphia, will close next month. The once-mighty Borders chain is on the rocks. Powell's, the huge store in Portland, Oregon, said sales were so weak that it was encouraging its staff to take unpaid sabbaticals.

Do not blame this carnage on the recession or any of the usual suspects, including increased competition for the reader's time or diminished attention spans. What is undermining the book industry is not the absence of casual readers but the changing habits of devoted readers.

In other words, it is all the fault of people like myself, who increasingly use the Internet both to buy books and later, after their value to us is gone, to sell them. This is not about Amazon peddling new books at discounted prices, which has been a factor in the book business for a decade, but about the rise of a worldwide network of amateurs who sell books from their homes or, if they are lazy like me, in partnership with an Internet dealer who does all the work for a chunk of the proceeds.

They get their books from friends, yard sales, recycling centers, their own shelves, castoffs. Some list them for as little as a penny, although most aim for at least a dollar. This growing market is achieving an aggregate mass that is starting to prove problematic for publishers, new bookstores and secondhand bookstores.

For readers and collectors, these resellers, as they are called, offer a great service. Lost in the hand-wringing over the state of the book industry is the fact that this is a golden age for those in love with old-fashioned printed volumes: More books are available for less effort and less money than ever before. A book search engine like ViaLibri.net can knit together 20,000 booksellers around the world offering tens of millions of nearly new, used or rare books.

One consequence has been to change the calculations traditionally involved in buying a book: Given the price, do I really want to read this? Now it has become an economic and a moral issue. How much do I want to pay, and where do I want that money to go? To my community via a bookstore? To the publisher? To the author?

In theory, I want to support all of these fine folks. In practice, I decide to save a buck.

Here is one example of how I casually wreak destruction. I was reading "Sylvia," an account by the late short-story master Leonard Michaels of his unstable first wife. Looking for material about Michaels, I saw his friend Wendy Lesser had written a long essay about him in a book published last year by Pantheon. I could buy a new paperback edition of that book, "Room for Doubt," for $13.95 plus tax in a bookstore. But there were dozens of copies available online from resellers for as little as one cent, plus shipping.

A penny felt a little chintzy, even for me, so I bought a hardcover copy for 25 cents from someone who called herself Heather Blue, plus a few bucks for shipping. Neither my local bookstore nor Pantheon - whose parent, Random House, announced this month it would cut costs by reducing five divisions to three - nor the author got a share. The book looked good as new.

Lesser is the publisher of The Threepenny Review, a literary journal. She lives in Berkeley, California, where, as it happens, there is no longer a large, general-interest bookstore. Cody's, which was once one of the country's great stores, closed its last outlet in June. The Barnes & Noble store there also recently closed.

Andy Ross, the former owner of Cody's, told me that buying books online "was not morally dubious, but it is tragic. It has a lot of unintended consequences for communities."
