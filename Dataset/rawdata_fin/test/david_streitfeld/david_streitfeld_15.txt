A “residential unit” is one where the renter tries to illegally live in the unit. “We used to see one or two residential units a month,” Mr. Reger said. “Now I’m seeing 6 or 8 or 10. At one facility in D.C. the other day, we had three residentials.”

Not every area is seeing an increase in auctions. Neal Grossman, who runs auctions at storage facilities in Ohio, said a higher percentage of storage customers are rescuing their possessions at the last minute.

When renters default on their monthly payments, facilities replace the lock with one of their own. That way, the renter cannot come around at the last minute and empty out his unit.

Mr. Grossman cut locks on 87 units in March but, as many people paid at the last minute, ended up auctioning only 21 of them in April. Both numbers were down from a year ago, he said, suggesting “the worst is behind us.”

In Chicago, on the other hand, the ranks of the dispossessed seem to be swelling. Storage facilities in Illinois that intend to auction off units in default must publish a legal notice alerting the owners. The suburban Daily Herald ran notices for 62 auctions in the Chicago metro area on a recent Monday, some of them involving more than 10 units.

Brook Snyder runs the Chicago operation for Blair Auction. A good-humored 34-year-old with a penchant for bright shirts and three-day stubble, Mr. Snyder has made a career of delivering bad news: He has been an assistant to court officers doing evictions as well as a process server delivering legal papers to people being sued.

“I try to treat everyone with respect,” Mr. Snyder said. “Anyone can have hard times.”

On auction days he drives from site to site, trailing a caravan of hopeful bidders. When everyone is assembled in front of a defaulted unit, he takes off the lock. Forbidden to enter or touch, bidders make offers based on a glimpse and well-honed instinct. The entire process is over in a moment.

In three brisk days, Mr. Snyder held auctions at 23 U-Store-It facilities. At the first site, in Gurnee north of the city, he raised the door on an indoor unit, revealing what was essentially a one-room apartment: bed raised high, recumbent bicycle in the corner, file cabinet, vacuum cleaner and, for power, many extension cords. The contents sold for $675.

The next warehouse, in Waukegan, brought a unit full of — depending on how you look at it — cherished household possessions or somebody’s trash. Most of the bidders took the latter view, disdaining an offer. Tonya Boyd bought the bulging plastic bags for all of $6. “It looks like someone had some troubles,” said Ms. Boyd, an employment specialist. There were piles of clothes, brand-new women’s shoes, old chairs, a dirty fan, kitchenware.

For some units, $6 is too much. “A dollar bill, first dollar bill takes it,” Mr. Snyder implored in front of one unit. “Come on, this is everything they own!” To no avail.

This is the eternal mystery of self-storage. If the material was worth money, it was foolish to let it go to default. If it was not worth much, why spend at least $50 a month to store it?

Mr. Jernigan, the U-Store-It executive, says budgets are stretched tight. “People pay their cellphone, rent, credit card before they get down to their storage unit,” he said.

Self-storage site managers describe an irrational tendency in some clients. One said she had seen customers who lost their possessions at auction come back and rent another unit. Mr. Snyder said he had removed a lock from the same delinquent unit six times in one year. Five times the renter had paid up at the last minute; the sixth time, a few weeks ago, it was auctioned.

“His luck ran out,” Mr. Snyder said.
