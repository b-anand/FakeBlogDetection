Not long ago, the sheriff of Wayne County in Michigan warned that the wave of foreclosures sweeping across Detroit and the rest of his territory was a threat to law-abiding citizens.

“Public safety is imperiled,” Sheriff Warren C. Evans wrote to the governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, “by the number of foreclosed citizens living on the street or committing crimes with the actual intent of being jailed.”

Stripped of their own house, the foreclosed were choosing the Big House.

This is the sort of misfortune that happens when times are bleak and so many are pushed to the brink. Crime and violence of all sorts ramp up. People burn their cars for the insurance money. They rob. They steal. They kill themselves.

Or so we assume. But if bad times have a special mythology, the reality is more elusive. In this extreme recession, reports of such incidents are easy to find — despite the fact that actual statistical increases in such behavior are often inconclusive if not downright illusory. The American Association of Suicidology, for instance, felt compelled to issue a statement in January saying that historically there is no clear association between periods of economic distress and suicide. Maybe this recession will be different, but that will not be clear until all the numbers have been collected a few years from now.

The voluntary prisoner in search of “three hots and a cot” is a persistent figure in American popular culture. He turns up in the folklore of the Depression and reappears in Bill Sands’s “My Shadow Ran Fast,” a bestseller in the 1960s that humanized life behind bars. And of course there was Otis Campbell, the town drunk on “The Andy Griffith Show” who let himself in and out of his cell at whim.

A spokesman for Sheriff Evans, who was pursuing an ill-fated bid to become mayor of Detroit, referred me to Jeriel Heard, Wayne County’s chief of jails and courts. “Before, we would get a dozen voluntary incarcerations a year,” Chief Heard said. “Now we’re looking at four or five a week.”

The crimes committed were mostly of the public-disorder variety, he said, purposely done in front of the police to attract their attention: throwing an empty wine bottle or urinating in public, perhaps breaking into a foreclosed house. The offenders were seeking not only food and shelter but medical care. They had no previous criminal history. “The criminal justice system,” Chief Heard said, “is becoming the safety net of last resort.”

Chad Audi, the president of Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, a program that operates a shelter and works with former prisoners, also said he was seeing a troubling increase in intentional commitments, although in his experience the people involved often had done time before.

“They love to go to jail, because this is their comfort zone,” Dr. Audi said. “One man told us he went and stole a bag of chips from a gas station just so he could go to jail and get help for his teeth. That is how petty this is.”

With the jails filling up, Dr. Audi said he worried that the lawbreaking would not remain petty much longer. “People will be forced to commit a violent crime to get into the system,” he said.

As if in confirmation, a man named James A. Roberts in February robbed a bank in Lincoln, Neb., of $3,000, and then waited outside until the police came. Mr. Roberts, 52, told the police that he had been laid off and could not find a place to live. In his mug shot, he looked pleased.

Examples in Detroit, however, have been harder to come by. Chief Heard agreed to set up an interview with a prisoner driven to crime by the recession the next time one arrived. But no one did. Social service workers were generally dismissive of the idea. In the shelters, the homeless said they had heard stories of people intentionally getting themselves locked up but that was long ago.

One of them, Kevin Allen, 54, said he couldn’t imagine trying to put himself in jail. "I did six months when I was 18, and that was enough for me," Mr. Allen said.

The mythology of bad times also calls for a rise in insurance scams. Accounts of car torchings are indeed plentiful. A Tucson man who owed much more on his 2006 Dodge Charger than it was worth is accused of persuading his daughter’s boyfriend to set it on fire. In exchange, the man agreed to let the boyfriend marry the girl. Both are now facing charges. There have been dozens of other stories only slightly less bizarre.

Yet research by John R. Hall Jr. of the National Fire Protection Association has shown that intentional fires of all sorts have been declining since 1980, and that there were no notable spikes in recession years. One reason: Revenge or spite was a more common motive in arson than profit.

If any crime were boosted by economic downturns, it would likely be burglary and other forms of theft. But in Los Angeles, where unemployment and foreclosures are rampant, crimes of all types are falling. Property crimes, for instance, are down 7 percent this year compared with 2008, the Los Angeles Police Department said last week.

As for Detroit’s voluntary incarcerations, the chief of jails now says the people doing this are so unbalanced they literally might not know what they are doing.

Brian Moore, a 49-year-old homeless Detroit man, says he thinks that is about the only way it could be happening.

Some time ago, in the middle of a miserable winter, Mr. Moore was so empty of luck that he decided he had no choice but to go back to jail. He had only a single dollar left, he recalled, and it was ripped in half. So he decided to go to a neighborhood restaurant, where he would stuff himself and then reveal he had no money. The police would handle the rest.

At the restaurant, Mr. Moore feasted on meatloaf and mashed potatoes and fried chicken while drinking three cups of coffee and a bottle of soda. The waitress was already eyeing him suspiciously. All he had to do was confess. But with his stomach full and his body warm, freedom regained its allure, he said. Mr. Moore waited until the waitress was distracted and then ran out the door.
