After a worrisome start to the growing season that fanned fears of food shortages and huge economic losses, the nation’s most important crop is now on track for a bountiful harvest, the government said Tuesday.

The Department of Agriculture is forecasting the second-highest corn yield on record with production of 12.3 billion bushels, about 600 million bushels more than it had expected earlier in the summer.

“We dodged a bullet,” said Bill Nelson, a Wachovia grains analyst.

As cool weather in April and downpours in May gave way to widespread flooding in June, prospects seemed miserable for corn. That crop has long been the most important feed used in meat production, and in recent years it has increased in importance as ethanol made from corn has become a government-mandated gasoline additive.

Many farmers had to replant their washed-out fields; some ran out of time to do so. Food industry groups went to battle with ethanol interests, saying there was not enough corn for both food and fuel. Corn futures prices soared to an unheard-of $8 a bushel, triple the price of a few years ago.

Some analysts worried that $9 or even $10 a bushel was possible. That price would probably have been ruinous to livestock producers and ethanol plants alike, although corn farmers would have been in clover.

But after the floodwaters receded, nature turned benign. In the Midwest this summer, the weather has been exactly what the tender young corn stalks needed to thrive. “Not too hot, not too cold, not too wet, not too dry,” Mr. Nelson said.

Corn prices, which have been falling for weeks, settled Tuesday at $5.28 a bushel, up 11 cents.

The highest corn yield on record was 160.4 bushels an acre in 2004. The new 2008 estimate of 155 bushels is up 3.9 bushels from last year’s harvest. Total production will be lower than last year’s bumper crop, because farmers planted fewer acres of corn.

The soybean crop is slightly more of a question mark, since it was planted even later than corn. The government is forecasting a harvest of 2.97 billion bushels, down about 30 million bushels from its earlier forecasts. But that is much better than many had expected in June.

Palle Pedersen, an agronomist at Iowa State University in Ames, said it was too early to tell how the soybean crop would turn out in the state, which was hit hardest in the flooding. “I think the government yield estimates are too high,” he said. “A lot of disease is coming in, killing the fields.”

Soybean futures have also fallen back, although not as much as corn. At the beginning of July, they exceeded $16 a bushel. On Tuesday, they settled at $12.14.

The jump in commodity prices this year became a major burden on livestock producers and other food industry groups, which began campaigning for relief. But their cause has had two major setbacks in the last month.

The Agriculture Department decided not to let farmers take land out of conservation programs without penalty, a measure that would have increased production in 2009. Then the Environmental Protection Agency denied a request by the governor of Texas to reduce for one year the mandate on ethanol production.

Despite the much-improved prospects for the crops, and thus lower prices for feed, the livestock producers’ enthusiasm was muted Tuesday.

“The crop report is certainly a good thing,” a National Chicken Council spokesman, Richard Lobb, said. “But we’re still basically just squeaking through. The federal government seems to be relying on a policy of hoping for good weather, not just this year but in the coming years.”

Farmers, who are inherently cautious, are not banking on any good news until after the harvest is safely in the silos. The government corn yield estimate of 155 bushels an acre is a dream to some of them.

Dan Meinhart, a farmer in Effingham, Ill., said the conditions in his area did not reflect the government’s optimism. Mr. Meinhart had to replant nearly all his corn and beans after the rains washed them away. He is expecting a corn yield of 130 bushels. The beans do not look great either.

“Spanish needles are blooming already, and the old-timers say that means it will frost in six weeks,” Mr. Meinhart said. “We need at least eight to 10 weeks to get the crop in.”

In its report, the government said that corn yields would be higher than last year in the northern and eastern corn belt, but lower in the southern half of the Great Plains because of drought. Soybean yields are projected to be lower in the Midwest, a consequence of the troubles this spring, but higher in most other places.

The report is based primarily on phone interviews with 29,500 producers. Agriculture Department personnel went back to 8,910 tracts in the Midwest after the floods and did special interviews with farmers about their planted acreage and harvest intentions.
