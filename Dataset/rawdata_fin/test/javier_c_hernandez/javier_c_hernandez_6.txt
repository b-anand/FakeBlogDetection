Wall Street shares slid sharply on Thursday as a stronger dollar lured investors away from riskier stock markets and commodities like gold and oil.

Relatively bright economic reports did little to quell nervousness over the health of the broader economy, leaving traders wondering whether the momentum behind a remarkable stretch of gains, with the major indexes touching 13-month highs this week, was sustainable.

The losses were broad-based but most severe in financial, technology and energy stocks, which are subject to changes in the price of commodities like metals and petroleum.

In the last eight months, the weak dollar has helped propel a dazzling rally in the stock markets, as investors moved their assets into riskier equity markets in the hope of higher returns. Persistently low interest rates in the United States have made the dollar a less lucrative investment, but on Thursday, investors were snapping up the currency, sending stocks tumbling.

At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 93.87 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,332.44. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 14.9 points, or 1.34 percent, to 1,094.90 — its biggest drop this month.

The Nasdaq composite index also had its biggest decline of the month, falling 36.32 points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,156.82, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded its assessment of eight chip makers. Intel fell 4 percent and Texas Instruments fell 3.4 percent.

Jason D. Pride, director of research at Haverford Investments, said Thursday’s sell-off reflected deeper concern over the pace of economic recovery.

“Now we’re getting to the point where truly the market needs to see meat, more so than just a little bit of a flash of meat,” he said. “Any time a piece of information comes out that suggests that we don’t have a truly sustainable recovery yet, the market backs off.”

Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said traders were also looking to cash in on the year’s strong performance.

“It’s about a healthy and overdue profit-taking,” he said. “The hedge funds and investment managers are trying to move into hibernation mode from now to the year-end. A lot have had great years, and they really want to reduce risk.”

The dollar, which in recent weeks has dropped to 15-month lows, posted gains against world currencies, hovering above $1.49 against the euro.

The bond market benefited from the dollar’s gains, with the price of the benchmark 10-year note climbing 7/32 to 100 10/32. The yield was 3.34 percent, down from 3.36 percent late Wednesday.

Gold fell to $1,144.60 an ounce, down from $1,145.50 on Wednesday, and copper fell 3 cents, to $3.08 a pound. Oil dropped to $77.46 a barrel, from $79.58 on Wednesday.

Investors seemed indifferent to a Labor Department report suggesting the rate of layoffs in the United States was slowing as the number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week held steady, meeting expectations.

Over all, the number of people continuing to claim benefits fell by 39,000 to 5.61 million the week before, slightly worse than expectations. Analysts cautioned that the drop did not necessarily mean more people were finding jobs — many Americans have exhausted unemployment benefits and are no longer included in the government’s tallies.

The relatively reassuring employment figures collided with news that AOL would reduce its work force by a third.

The Conference Board predicted economic growth over the next six months, but not at a fast enough rate to placate Wall Street. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region grew in November at the fastest rate in two years.
