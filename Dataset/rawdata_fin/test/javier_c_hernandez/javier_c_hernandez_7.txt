Hints of a slowdown in the housing market and a batch of dim forecasts from technology companies turned Wall Street traders cautious on Wednesday, with the major indexes retreating slightly from 13-month highs.

The losses were driven by drops in shares of information technology and utilities companies, which declined after weaker-than-expected earnings forecasts.

In addition, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that in October, builders broke ground on new homes at the slowest rate in six months. Construction of apartment buildings reached the lowest level since the department started collecting housing data in 1959, and building permits, an indicator of future construction, also fell.

The data fell short of expectations and created worries that the housing market, which has led this decade’s cycle of economic boom and bust, could be headed for a hesitant recovery.

At the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 11.11 points, or 0.11 percent, at 10,426.31. The wider Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 0.52 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,109.80. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 10.64 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,193.14.

The biggest losses came in technology. Autodesk, a large maker of engineering software, said its fourth-quarter profit would be lower than expected, sending its shares down 10.4 percent. Salesforce.com, the largest seller of online customer management software, reported strong profit but said it would bolster hiring, a costly move that seemed to disappoint some investors. Its shares fell 3.1 percent.

Shares in Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and Intel also declined.

Bill Stone, chief investment strategist for PNC Wealth Management, said traders had shown a readiness in recent months to sell technology stocks when faced with even the slightest hint of negativity.

“When you’re the best-performing sector by definition, your expectations have risen the most,” he said. “You have a hurdle that’s a little higher to jump over.”

Financial stocks were one of the few areas to post gains, led by shares of Bank of America. Its stock increased 3.7 percent after Moody’s upgraded its assessment of the company’s strength, and John A. Paulson, an influential billionaire investor, said its shares could double in the next two years.

The slower pace in home construction was attributed to uncertainty in October over whether Congress would renew a credit for first-time home buyers. (This month, lawmakers voted to extend it through April.)

David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff & Associates, an investment firm, said the housing numbers raised questions about the strength of the underlying economy.

“It tells you a thing or two about how reliant we are on the government sector for prosperity,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “It’s still extremely difficult to get a sense of what the U.S. economy looks like organically.”

Overseas, markets were mostly down. The CAC 40 in France was flat, the FTSE 100 in Britain fell 0.1 percent, and the DAX in Germany climbed 0.2 percent.

Gold continued to make gains, climbing to $1,145.50, as investors looked for a safe haven for their money. Oil increased slightly, to $79.58 a barrel. The dollar fell against other world currencies, trading at slightly less than $1.50 against the euro, even as United States policy makers in recent days have reiterated support for the currency.

On Tuesday, Wall Street indexes reached highs for 2009, largely because of a surge in commodity prices that helped buoy shares of energy and materials companies.

The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 11/32, to 100 3/32. The yield rose to 3.36 percent, from 3.32 percent late Tuesday.
