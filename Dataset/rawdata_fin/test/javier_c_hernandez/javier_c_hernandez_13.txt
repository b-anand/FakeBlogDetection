They stood beneath the vacant building in Lower Manhattan on Saturday and prayed. A mother, father and widow, haunted by that day last August, forced their eyes upon the building they had tried to eliminate from their memories.

“I’m numb. I’m not thinking,” said Rosemarie Graffagnino, the mother of Joseph Graffagnino, a 33-year-old firefighter who died battling a fire at the building, the Deutsche Bank tower, last year. “That’s the way you survive sometimes.”

It has been 309 days since the fire tore through the empty tower near ground zero, killing Firefighter Graffagnino and a colleague, Robert Beddia, 53.

“They should blow that building up so nobody has to look at it anymore,” said Firefighter Graffagnino’s widow, Linda, who, like his parents, had avoided the site since the fire.

On Saturday, more than 100 friends and family members of both fallen firefighters and elected officials marched from the boarded-up high rise, which was badly damaged on 9/11 and was in the process of being dismantled when the fire broke out, to City Hall. They called for fire safety improvements and more stringent safety codes at buildings and construction sites. They wore navy blue shirts emblazoned with the men’s nicknames and vowed to fight for safer working conditions.

Over the past year, the Graffagnino family has oscillated between sorrow and rage. They miss Firefighter Graffagnino’s gleaming smile and brawny hugs, and are eager to get answers from a pending investigation into the fire by the Manhattan district attorney’s office.

“The people who are to blame are going to pay,” Rosemarie Graffagnino said. “They think they can get away with murder, but they can’t.”

Confidence in the city’s construction industry has suffered after several fatal accidents, including two crane collapses in Manhattan, this year. As a result, the city has moved to hire more inspectors and has increased the number of safety examinations at construction sites.

An investigation after the Deutsche Bank blaze uncovered several fire hazards, including the absence of a piece of standpipe intended to carry water to higher floors. Federal safety regulators have accused the contractors who were taking down the building of ignoring safety risks.

The rally on Saturday was meant to put pressure on government officials to ensure that proper safety measures are put in place and enforced to prevent disasters. “We want to save other families from going through what we went through,” Rosemarie Graffagnino said. “We don’t want anyone else to die.”

The rally also coincided with the first anniversary of the death of another firefighter, Daniel F. Pujdak, who fell four stories to his death while fighting a Brooklyn fire.

Some demonstrators held signs calling for the dismissal of city officials, and others criticized what they saw as a tendency by construction companies and the city to cut corners rather than commit to an investment in equipment and enforcement.

Firefighter Graffagnino’s father, also named Joseph, is advocating the use of technology, including radio-frequency identification instead of roll calls, to help pinpoint the location of each firefighter at a fire.

“The city needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century,” he said.

Linda Graffagnino lives in Brooklyn, a block and a half from her in-laws. After he was killed, she had a tattoo etched on her left arm bearing her husband’s Fire Department badge number, 375.

“He was my best friend. He was the best father,” she said.

The family sees his face in his two children, 4-year-old Mia and 19-month-old Joseph, and they try to devote their time to watching the children grow. They miss the days when Firefighter Graffagnino would come home from work and play hide-and-seek with his daughter, usually hiding behind the couch.

At night, they barely sleep.

“You go home and sit in the dark and think and it all comes back,” said Firefighter Graffagnino’s father. “Everything changes — your whole focus, your purpose. All the fun you have is tinged with sadness.”
