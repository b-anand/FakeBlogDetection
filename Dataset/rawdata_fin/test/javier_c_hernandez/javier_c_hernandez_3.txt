 Stocks fell on Wednesday as investors digested gloomy numbers on sales of new homes and were unmoved by a report that showed a rise in United States durable goods orders.

New one-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 402,000 in September, the Commerce Department said, falling short of the 440,000 projected by economists. That was a 3.6 percent decrease from the revised rate for August and the first drop since March. Analysts had expected new-home sales to increase 2.6 percent, encouraged in part by a popular $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers.

Sales of new homes have implications for construction jobs as well as consumer spending on items like furniture and appliances.

Stocks were down all day, but selling accelerated in the final hours of trading. Stocks in energy companies and in companies producing materials like metals and paper goods drove the decreases.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.48 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 9,762.69. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 20.78 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,042.63, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 56.48 points, or 2.67 percent, to 2,059.61.

Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, a financial advisory firm, said the housing data showed that the recovery would be slow and that housing prices might fall again.

“It’s still a very dicey environment,” he said. “There’s still a lot of looming supply out there, particularly in the upper and middle price range.”

The government said orders for durable goods rose 1 percent in September — the second increase in the last three months. But while the increase was in line with expectations, orders were down 24.1 percent from a year earlier.

Durable goods, which include items like refrigerators and planes, offer a window into the health of the manufacturing sector and are an indicator of how busy factories will be in the months ahead. Increases in durable goods orders can lead to more jobs and are considered central to the growth of the economy.

Some analysts discounted the importance of the durable-goods numbers, saying the increase was largely anticipated. But Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance, an economic research group, said the data suggested manufacturing would be slow to take off again.

“It paints a clear picture of a weak-kneed recovery,” he said. “There’s no aggressive, entrepreneurial, animal-spirits kind of investment.”

Financial stocks were down slightly as news spread that GMAC Financial Services was seeking a third round of bailout financing from the United States government.

At the close of Wednesday trading, the price of crude oil had fallen to $77.46 a barrel, from $79.55 on Tuesday.

Traders may have been looking ahead to the government’s gross domestic product figures, which are scheduled for release on Thursday. Wall Street analysts are expecting an annual growth rate of 3.2 percent, although on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs reduced its projection to 2.7 percent, from 3 percent.

Overseas, the Nikkei stock average in Japan closed down 1.35 percent at 10,075.05. European markets also tumbled, with the FTSE 100 in Britain shedding 2.32 percent, the DAX in Germany falling 2.46 percent and the CAC 40 in France dropping 2.14 percent.

The price of the Treasury’s 10-year note rose 8/32, to 101 23/32, while the yield fell to 3.41 percent, from 3.44 percent late Tuesday.
