A day after a spirited rally sent the Dow to its highest levels since the beginning of the financial crisis, Wall Street took a moment to breathe, with stocks showing little or no gains on Tuesday.

From the opening bell to the close, the enthusiasm of Monday’s rally, which pushed the Dow up more than 200 points, seemed to have dissipated. The dollar remained weak, and a rush for gold slowed slightly.

At the end, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 20.03 points, or 0.2 percent, at 10,246.97. The broader Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index declined less than a point to 1,093.01, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 2.98 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,151.08.

The stock exchanges will be open Wednesday on Veteran’s Day, but the bond markets will be closed.

Shares of financial companies, particularly regional banks, were among laggards. Zions Bancorp declined 7.66 percent, to $13.26; SunTrust fell 3.38 percent, to $20.29; and Huntington Bancshares 3.55 percent, to $3.80. Bank of America, however, rose 1.65 percent, to $16.03, after it said that its integration with Merrill Lynch would generate more savings than expected. American Express rose 1.6 percent, to $39.68, on reports that worldwide credit card spending had increased by 3 percent in October — a sign that consumers might be more optimistic about spending.

The dollar, which has lost 16 percent of its value since March, continued to trade near $1.50 against the euro and fell against other currencies as well. While the dollar is considered a safe-haven investment, low interest rates have kept its yield down, and in response investors have thrown their money to Wall Street in search of higher returns. The price of gold, which in recent weeks has hit record highs nearly every day, climbed slightly, to $1,105.60 an ounce.

Even as the stock market continues an eight-month rally, there are concerns over the speed of a recovery. On Tuesday, the presidents of the Federal Reserve banks in San Francisco and Atlanta suggested that unemployment, which hit a 26-year high in October, could continue to remain high for several years. Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve in San Francisco, said growth was sustainable but that it would not happen fast enough to bring down unemployment anytime soon.

“High unemployment, weak job growth and paltry wage increases are a recipe for sluggish consumer spending growth and a tepid recovery,” Ms. Yellen told a real estate group in Phoenix.

Also on Tuesday, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who heads the Senate banking committee, released a proposal to overhaul the financial system. He called for establishing an agency to protect consumers and for giving the government more authority to break up companies that pose a threat to the stability of the system.

Oil prices settled down 38 cents, at $79.05 a barrel, as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico began to subside.

Investors expect earnings reports from major retailers later this week, including Macy’s, Wal-Mart and J. C. Penney. As the holiday season approaches, those results will give a snapshot of the state of consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of the United States economy.

Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for ChannelCapitalResearch.com, said investors were ignoring signs that consumer spending might be weak in the coming months, given cost-cutting by companies and a steady rise in the unemployment rate.

“Nobody wants to fight the rally,” he said. “The market is showing a natural pullback at this point, and we will probably see a consolidation phase for awhile.”

In London, shares of HSBC were about 4 percent higher after the bank said its profit in the quarter ended in September was “significantly ahead” of a year earlier. Shares of a rival, Barclays, were down 5.1 percent after profit declined 54 percent. And the Lloyds Banking Group’s shares dropped slightly after the bank announced plans to lay off an additional 5,000 workers.

Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Ohio, said Wall Street would probably continue to inch upward, with occasional downturns, as investors gunned for a strong finish to 2009.

“There’s a lot of money on the sidelines that has missed out on stocks being up,” Mr. Mayland said. “And time to the year-end is getting short.”

The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 4/32, to 101 8/32. The yield fell to 3.47 percent from 3.49 percent on Monday.
