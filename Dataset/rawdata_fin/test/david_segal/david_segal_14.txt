THERE will be admirers of Floyd Abrams, the most famous First Amendment lawyer in the country, who are surprised to learn that he represents a corporation widely regarded as Part of the Problem in the economic meltdown. These people are likely to have a passing familiarity with Mr. Abrams’s four-decade career and think of him as a tribune of free speech and a defender of underdogs.

Floyd Abrams is representing S.&P. at a crucial moment, when many people fault rating agencies as signing off on junk.

Mr. Abrams has some advice for these admirers: Get over it.

“People sometimes have views of what side of issues I should be on that have little to do with reality,” he says. “I don’t spend my life simply working for the A.C.L.U.”

For much of the foreseeable future, the famous eloquence and pugnacity of this 73-year-old titan of the bar will serve Standard & Poor’s, the largest of the credit rating agencies. The company, along with its rivals, Moody’s and Fitch, stamped high grades on billions of dollars of debt that went septic as the housing market collapsed. The three have spent much of the last year explaining those grades and other mysteries, like why they gave the Wall Street equivalent of gold stars to the debt of a handful of companies, including Lehman Brothers before it went under and A.I.G. before its rescue.

Until a few months ago, overhauling the rating agencies looked like the proverbial low-hanging fruit of financial industry reform. But legislators have so far been unable or unwilling to truly take on the companies. Now, a number a plaintiff’s lawyers are about to try their luck in court.

Actually, many courts. Dozens of investors have filed lawsuits seeking redress from the rating agencies, contending that the companies bear responsibility for investors’ losses, under a Whitman’s sampler of theories. The recession, in other words, is about to begin its litigation phase, and Mr. Abrams and a handful of partners at the law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel are readying defenses for more than 30 suits filed against S.& P. Up first, an oral argument on a motion to dismiss one case is set for July 31.

What is this veteran of free-speech battles doing on the payroll of a company that analyzes securities?

Making an argument about the First Amendment, to begin with. Mr. Abrams will contend that S.& P.’s ratings deserve exactly the sort of free-speech protections afforded to journalists, on the theory that a bond rating is like an editorial — an opinion based on an educated guess about the future. And for the same reason you can’t sue editorial writers, Mr. Abrams will argue that you can’t sue a bond rater because the economy went into a free fall that few saw coming.

“It shouldn’t change the legal dynamics that rating agencies are more important, or play a greater role, or are looked to by this or that element of the marketplace,” he says. “The major similarity here is that both the newspaper and S.& P. are offering opinions on matters that people can and do disagree about.”

Legal scholars give this argument marks that range from “certainly plausible” to “you’re kidding, right?” But Mr. Abrams won’t just be talking about free speech. The First Amendment is no defense against fraud, and that is what is alleged by many of the plaintiffs. Against them, Mr. Abrams will argue that S.& P. was every bit as blindsided as nearly everyone else in the private sector and in the regulatory sphere.

It’s obviously true, he will tell judges and juries, that many of the ratings “didn’t pan out,” as he puts it, but that doesn’t mean the company is liable for investor losses.

Variations of these arguments have worked for S.& P. in the past. In fact, aside from a small settlement in an Orange County, Calif., case 10 years ago, no litigant has wrested even token sums from S.& P. Which means that today, the company stands roughly where the tobacco companies stood in the mid-1990s: unpopular in public, virtually undefeated in court.

The fortunes of Big Tobacco, you might recall, changed substantially for the worse as more people came to believe that cigarette makers had misrepresented the dangers of their products. Ultimately, four tobacco companies settled for more than $200 billion with 46 attorneys general and today are heavily regulated by the government.

Mr. Abrams’s goal isn’t just to prevent a similar defeat, or to beat back litigants using the weapons he’s been wielding since the late ’60s. He wants more than that.

“Look, for the client’s interest, I very much hope that we can get rid of these litigations on motions for dismissal,” he says. “But from a personal point of view, I look forward to the chance to defend them against those charges in court. If we have a real trial, people would say terrible things about them and I would be very happy to show that those things aren’t so.”
