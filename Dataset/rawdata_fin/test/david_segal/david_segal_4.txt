ON the TV screen, a 30-ish guy is lounging in bed, talking on the phone, with an older woman curled up near his arm.

“Dude, there is no way your mom is cheating on your dad,” he says.

“That wasn’t Jay, was it?” the woman asks, once the guy has hung up.

“Yeah, that was your son. Don’t worry, he’s not going to find out.”

Freeze frame, and cue the narrator: “You think that’s low? Spirit Airlines fares are even lower.”

Subtle? No. Outrageous? Sure.

But Spirit seems to relish the outrageous. Originally a charter company that ferried passengers from the Midwest to Atlantic City, the privately held company has, since 2006, been taking the ultra-low-cost, à la carte approach to air travel to places it’s never been, at least in this country.

Spirit’s specialty is the supercheap ticket from a major American city to vacation spots like Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and it’s ideal for people spontaneous enough to jump on last-minute sales, sometimes for tickets that cost as little as $9, one way.

But consider yourself warned: Spirit unabashedly contends that its only obligation to customers is getting them safely from Point A to Point B. Everything else is extra. And like its European inspiration, Ryanair, the company takes the word “nonrefundable” very literally. There is no excuse, plea or tap dance that will save you from the $110 change fee if you miss your plane.

Not surprisingly, a lot of people find this — there is no other word — outrageous. Given that Spirit flies about seven million people a year, just one-tenth of the traffic handled by a traditional airline like United, it has inspired an amazing amount of online venting, to the Department of Transportation and on Web sites like consumeraffairs.com.

Most of it is from Spirit fliers who were charged fees they say they didn’t see coming, or couldn’t get refunds they thought they deserved, or who had to buy new tickets on different airlines when Spirit flights were canceled. (Spirit typically will offer to put you on its next plane, but if that plane doesn’t arrive for another day, and you need to leave that night, the response occasionally translates as, “Your problem, not ours.”)

Is this, as they say, any way to run an airline?

Yes it is, says Ben Baldanza, 47, Spirit’s chief executive. A short, genial guy with wire-rimmed glasses and a big smile, Mr. Baldanza has one of those naturally booming voices that suggests he’s giving a speech in a banquet hall, even when his audience is two feet away. One recent afternoon, he sat at a round table in his office here, in a generic-looking industrial park about 25 minutes northwest of Miami, and explained his rather pitiless approach to cost-cutting and complaining passengers — particularly those who he believes have nothing to complain about.

“We know that frustrations about Spirit exist,” he says. “To some extent, it’s about a mismatch of expectations. For years, in this industry, if you whined, we gave you something. You yell, we waive a fee. That’s created a general expectation that airlines will break their own policies — and we don’t.”

You can tell that Mr. Baldanza gets a kick out of such tough-love pronouncements, and he isn’t bothered by the occasional bouts of Internet battering he has endured over the years. Most notably, there was the time in 2007 when he accidentally hit “reply all” to an e-mail message from a customer demanding a refund for a flight after a delay caused him to miss a concert in Atlanta — as well as money for the hotel and show. “We owe him nothing as far as I’m concerned,” Mr. Baldanza wrote in his response, which turned up on many blogs. “Let him tell the world how bad we are. He’s never flown us before anyway and will be back when we save him a penny.”

In flusher times, it’s unlikely that anyone would talk about Spirit as a harbinger of the American airline business. But last week, the International Air Transport Association predicted that a decline in demand would lead to an industrywide loss of $4.7 billion in 2009.

And last year, as high fuel prices helped shut down some small airlines and nearly bankrupted a few large ones, Aviation Daily reported that in the second quarter of 2008, Spirit had the highest operating margins and lowest unit cost of any American carrier. (Even with those margins, Spirit ended up losing $16 million last year, an improvement over the $78 million loss it sustained in 2006. It barely broke even in 2007.)

By performing in a way that could be described as not horrible, all things considered, Spirit could become more of an industry model during the downturn, some analysts say.
