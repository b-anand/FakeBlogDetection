Last month, for the first time in its 37-year history, this media-shy company allowed a reporter to visit what is officially called the Ruby Tuesday Support Services Center, here in Maryville, just south of Knoxville. It’s a modern, three-building complex, with more than 35,000 square feet of cubicles, classrooms, test kitchens and roughly 370 very cheerful employees. If you have always assumed that every casual chain restaurant has a nerve center and idea laboratory, you’re right — and this is what it looks like.

The chain is keeping some menu staples, like the ribs that Anthony Barbaretti ordered in Maryville, Tenn. 

A group of chefs work on the first floor in the main building, confecting and painstakingly market-testing the next “craveable,” as standout dishes are known. And the company is stepping up its already extensive training program, called Wow-U, flying in managers weekly from across the country and preaching an astoundingly detailed catechism of rules, etiquette and sales tactics known as “the Ruby Way.”

The trick is for the company to elevate its image without alienating those customers who actually liked the dowdier original. Mr. Beall, a supremely confident man, sounds unworried.

“We lost about 5 percent to 8 percent of our base by upgrading, mostly at lower income levels,” he says with a shrug. “Very few people miss the roller skates on the wall and the bad food.”

PAT PETERSON is teaching “Service Engagement” in front of about 60 Ruby Tuesday managers. Like a lot of the lecturers here, he’s been with the company for more than a decade; he started as a part-time cook and is now director of quality and innovation.

Mr. Peterson has boundless energy, and he paces back and forth in front of his students — most of them men in their 30s and 40s — shouting and gesticulating like a TV pitchman selling a Miracle Mop. He is recounting a night when two guys came into a Ruby Tuesday wearing Budweiser trucker hats. A waitress approached and asked something foolish: Want to try the sangria?

“What did the Budweiser brothers want?” Mr. Peterson shouts at the class.

“Bud,” the class replies in improvised unison.

“A cold beer, right! They couldn’t have been more clear about that if they walked in with a buzzing neon sign that said ‘Give me a Budweiser!’ If you want to get really frisky you might have sold them up to a Sam Adams handcrafted draft or something like that, but I wouldn’t have gone anywhere near sangria. Because these are not sangria people.”

His audience nods.

“And when I approach that table with sangria, then I’m making clear from the very beginning, this is about me winning a contest or my manager is bugging me about selling sangria, or whatever it is. ‘Hey, I don’t care what you want. I’m going to nudge you to what I think you need.’

“Does that make sense to everybody?”

Class: “Yes.”

“Is it something we want to be doing?”

Class: “No.”

“Is it something we’re doing every day?”

Class: “Yes.”

“Exactly! And we’re going to have to break out of that.”

When people say the restaurant business is tough, they are usually referring to the challenge of running only a single restaurant. So how do you run 896? And how do you run 896 as you trade up virtually every protocol, ingredient and recipe, not to mention the uniforms, cutlery and ambience?

Now add this wrinkle: Ruby Tuesday employs 43,000 people, and its annual rate of turnover is currently 100 percent. That doesn’t mean that everyone leaves in a given year; many of the managers stay for a long time. But there’s enormous churn on the rungs below.

“And 100 percent, that’s really good,” says Robert LeBoeuf, whose Ruby Tuesday title is chief people manager. “Three years ago, we were at 135 percent.”

This rotating staff must be tightly managed, but it is never supposed to sound overly scripted. As with every casual dining chain, Ruby Tuesday embraces the upside of fast-food uniformity (identical meals, no matter which restaurant you visit), but wants none of its downsides (a sense of prefab cooking that is delivered by programmed servers).

So while the company has thick orientation and training manuals, the point of Wow-U is not to rehash the regulations. It’s to acquaint managers with the art of improvising within those regulations, so they can teach underlings to do likewise.
