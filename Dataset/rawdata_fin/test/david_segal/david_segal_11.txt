The renowned investor Warren Buffett was uncharacteristically critical of himself and the business world at large in his annual letter to the shareholders of his holding company on Saturday, as he sifted through the wreckage of his worst year in four decades.

Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a 62 percent drop in net income for 2008 and posted negative results for only the second time since he took control in 1965.

Buffett took the blame for some of that grim performance, stating that he "did some dumb things," but he also registered anger at the decisions and practices in the rest of the business world that he predicted would leave the stock market a shambles through 2009.

The letter, as ever, gives shareholders an overview of Berkshire's annual performance, but it also doubles as a folksy state-of-the-economy address from one of the country's most revered investors.

In language that was by turns blunt and witty, he lamented what he called "a series of life-threatening problems within many of the world's great financial institutions." His heaviest scolding was reserved for the heads of private equity firms and mortgage issuers.

Buffett, an inveterate optimist about the American economy, also found reasons for cheer.

"As we view Geico's current opportunities," he wrote, referring to the insurance company that Berkshire Hathaway owns, he and his company's chief executive "feel like two hungry mosquitoes in a nudist camp. Juicy targets are everywhere."

Reviewing the performance of Clayton Homes, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that sells manufactured homes, he noted that its lending arm had managed to keep foreclosure rates to less than 4 percent, even among subprime borrowers, or those with weak credit ratings.

He contrasted that relative success with the failures of just about everyone else in that business.

"The stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed, history-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors," he wrote.

He went on: "These parties looked at loss experience over periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then made this experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had recently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn't afford."

Also blissfully ignored, he wrote, were the perils of relying on mathematical models devised without worst-case situations in mind. Too often, he wrote, Americans have been enamored of "a nerdy-sounding priesthood, using esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the like." Some skepticism about these models is overdue, he added.

"Our advice: Beware of geeks bearing formulas."

Buffett was just as scathing on the subject of derivatives, which he famously likened to weapons of mass destruction long before they started eviscerating the balance sheets of banks around the world.

In his letter, Buffett explained that the danger of derivatives was not merely the difficulty in assessing their value; rather, it was the "web of mutual dependence" they create among financial institutions. Derivatives contracts keep various parties entangled for years.

Once those assets start deteriorating, he wrote, "Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: It's not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with."

Buffett also delved into the derivatives owned by Berkshire. He explained that they were structured in ways that required counterparties to make payments to Berkshire when the contracts were initiated, providing his company with an advance of $8.1 billion, referred to as a float.

"This float is similar to insurance float," he wrote. "If we break even on an underlying transaction, we will have enjoyed the use of free money for a long time."

Nonetheless, Berkshire recorded a loss of $5.1 billion, after adjusting the value of its derivatives holdings.

Still, Buffett's report was greeted with sighs of relief among some shareholders. "I'm delighted," said Janet Tavokoli, a derivatives expert and author of "Dear Mr. Buffett," about the credit crisis of 2008. "Of course it was a tough year Ñ the toughest year of his life. But I was concerned about the impact in operating earnings and I was prepared for much worse."

Buffett was unsparing about his own mistakes. For example, he bought a block of ConocoPhillips shares just as oil and gas prices were reaching their highest levels. The move was timed so poorly, he wrote, that even with a rebound in prices, the cost to Berkshire will probably be several billion dollars.

He also bought shares of two Irish banks for $244 million, which subsequently have decreased more than 89 percent. "The tennis crowd," he wrote, "would call my mistakes 'unforced errors.' "
