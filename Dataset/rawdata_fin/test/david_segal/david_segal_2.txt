At minimum, the brothers are focused on the director who gave them “Pulp Fiction,” Mr. Tarantino. “I’ve got their undivided attention, I can honestly say that,” Mr. Tarantino said in a phone interview. “They want ‘Inglourious Basterds’ to be a hit even more than I want it to be a hit. Even in the grand scheme of things, it’s more important to them than me.”

Elizabeth Banks and Seth Rogen in “Zack and Miri Make a Porno.” Its director says the Weinsteins gave it short shrift.

Expected to gross $40 million, “Miss Potter,” with Ewan McGregor and Renée Zellweger, brought in only $3 million.

Born promoters, the brothers have timed their mea culpas for maximum impact. “Inglourious Basterds” is one of several must-wins on a slate of roughly 10 Weinstein films on their way in coming months. The others are “Nine,” a film version of the Broadway musical, starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Penélope Cruz. There’s also “Halloween II” and an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s post-apocalypse bummer, “The Road,” starring Viggo Mortensen. For some of these films, “Inglourious” among them, the brothers had to bring in partners to split production and promotion expenses, which means they’ll split profits, too.

Will these guys be around to shepherd all these movies into theaters? The question has the sort of final-reel drama that the Weinsteins, in other circumstances, might savor. What’s certain is if there aren’t a few blockbusters in the near future, these guys are going to have to find new jobs.

Of course, rivals and reporters have issued dire predictions like that throughout the Weinsteins’ career. But there’s a difference. This time, it’s a Weinstein making the prediction.

“The ship’s riding on the slate,” Harvey says, sounding remarkably buoyant, all things considered. “If by February, when we release ‘Hoodwinked 2’ ” — he playfully thumps a hand on the table, dramatizing the sound of failure — “I’ll be driving you, or making cheap hamburgers, or selling trailers, or refrigerators, or something. If the slate works, we’re right back to plan.”

THE Weinsteins — Harvey is 57 year old, Bob is 54 — will not discuss how much money they have left in the bank, but just calling up and asking for an interview, you could get the impression they’re running low. A few years ago, you’d barely have the receiver off your ear before public relations specialists would call to vigorously frisk you about your intentions. Your request for a sit-down would initially be denied, but if you persisted, you would eventually be summoned to Harvey’s office, where he would praise your work and offer you some goodie — a book deal, for instance — if you wrote about something else.

Not now. The Weinstein Company doesn’t keep the same phalanx of P.R. pros on retainer, lost perhaps in a downsizing that included an 11 percent staff cut last year. Once you get into Harvey’s office, the most you can expect by way of enticing offers these days is a well-brewed cup of coffee.

That said, the brothers were downright generous with me when it came to screening their coming movies. In fact, they shared as much of their slate as was ready — six movies in all, as well as ads, DVDs and rough cuts of unfinished products.

The goal, they said, was to demonstrate the strength of these films. For Harvey, it also seemed as if the screenings were supposed to bolster his case if — or, perhaps in his mind, when — he had to complain about this article. We showed him everything and he still said we’re doomed, was the subtext. If there is such a thing as prevenge, this is it.

“You see this?” Harvey asks, pounding a finger against a sheet of paper. It’s a Nielsen NRG tracking poll, a gauge of public interest in coming movies. He points to figures besides “Inglourious Basterds.” Here’s the G-rated version of what he says next: “This is called ‘smash hit’!”

Behold the charming Harvey, a plumpish, easily excited man with ink-dark eyes, two days’ worth of facial stubble and a trace of a New York accent. He is self-deprecating, chatty and usually in a rush. He has about him that magnetic field of charisma that you recognize as soon as you pass through his orbit.

Happily, we won’t meet the irate Harvey, but those who have encountered him describe a combustible, thin-skinned creature who belongs in the Extreme Mammals exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History. In Hollywood, he is known for outbursts that elevate profanity and rage to a kind of performance art. He says that age, his daughters from a first marriage, and his second wife, the 33-year-old British clothing designer Georgina Chapman, have mellowed him. But even after decades at the epicenter of the film business, he and his brother seem to consider themselves gatecrashers at a party where everyone wonders how they got past the bouncer. They tend to believe that many people are rooting for their demise — reporters in particular.
