Until our economy went kerflooey, it was a whimsical reverie about the life that you could swap for the one that you were leading. It was a six-room bed-and-breakfast in Vermont that you bought and spruced up and managed into your dotage. Or a record deal, with tour support and 80 percent of the gate. Or some gadget you devised in the basement that was going to be huge.

It took many forms, the old Plan B, but it’s getting harder to conjure up any of them in detail. The idea of it is fading from our memory, obscured under the pile of bad news about layoffs and bank failures, beneath the letters with your 401(k) returns, which you learned to stop opening.

Instead, we have the new Plan B, which can be summarized this way: the best you can make of a worst-case scenario, the deal you cut with a fate you might be unable to avoid. Under the new Plan B, the fortunate merely hunker down. The less fortunate slide, against their will, into a lower tax bracket and sometimes into jobs they don’t want.

As badly as our economy is tottering, the number of Americans actually living the new Plan B is still small compared to those who are not. What is slowly spreading is worry about the new Plan B. It is becoming part of our interior monologue, the anxious static in our collective heads, one of the ordeals of this downturn that doesn’t easily lend itself to measurement, like the G.D.P. or the Dow. It is not part of the economy’s visible damage, like boarded-up stores or those recession-inspired eBay listings that start with “Hate to let these go!” or some variation on that theme.

But it’s palpable. It is part of the awkward conversation with your kids about why you can’t chip in for college, or why you might not be leaving them much of an inheritance, if you leave them an inheritance at all.

The old Plan B was a lark that you could enjoy even if you never got past the dreaming phase. The new Plan B is a menace you can fear even if you’re fully employed. It’s a threat rather than an option.

It can be foisted upon you in the way that it was foisted on Damian and Simone Lopez of Bakersfield, Calif. A UPS driver for 15 years, Mr. Lopez lost his job not long ago and today he welds aluminum tanks for a truck company. It’s solitary work, which isn’t his style, and it pays less than half the $75,000 he earned with UPS. The house he built with his wife, Simone, was foreclosed upon and will soon go up for auction.

“We’re hoping that whoever buys our house will rent it back to us,” said Mrs. Lopez, a mother of three who works at a career counseling center. “But we’re not sure we’ll be able to afford the rent.”

The Lopezes had a very different Plan B last year. It involved tuition money for a daughter in college, and a lot of golf outings in Arizona. “My husband used to collect all these golf guides,” Mrs. Lopez said. “I’m not even sure where he got them.”

We have questions for those forced into the new Plan B because these people seem like pioneers in a mental realm where we’re all headed. Is it as gruesome there as we fear? And how quickly are you forced to give up the stuff you don’t actually need (like Showtime and dinner out) and surrender the stuff you shouldn’t live without (like health care)?

And here’s a hopeful question: does the new Plan B have any upsides? For many, the primary goal of the old Plan B wasn’t riches. It was a means of exiting the H.O.V. lane of a career you might no longer have enjoyed. Or it was about finding “fulfillment,” a word that is nearly impossible to say without irony at the age of 21 and accumulates meaning later on.

Steve Maslow, a corporate headhunter in Manhattan, says some job candidates he has placed in the past now “see the writing on the wall” and have started to segue into work that they actually prefer. Like the lawyer who at night runs a florist business out of his apartment, or the derivatives products controller at a Wall Street firm who has opened a furniture show room in the basement of her house in New Jersey.

But these are exceptions.

“Just about everyone I work with is trying to figure out Plan B,” Mr. Maslow says, “but most people think of it as a stop-gap measure, a way to stop the bleeding, a place to go every day. It used to have the flavor of once-upon-a-time, the thing I’ll do when I’m 55 and have a nest egg. That’s pretty much over.”

It died, it seems, along with the nest egg. Part of the old Plan B was an imagined sit-down with a professional accountant who would run the numbers and tell you, yes, this will work, as long as you spend “X dollars” per year, and nothing more. Without the nest egg, there are no numbers to run. There are only extravagances to jettison.

“I got rid of everything luxurious,” says Bob Hunter, 52, a real estate investor in Miami, whose $8 million in holdings have plunged in value since the downturn. “I drive a Ford pickup truck. I used to drive a BMW 5 Series, and I was going to upgrade from there, to the 6 Series convertible.”

The old Plan B for Mr. Hunter was a two-day workweek, with the management of his properties handled by nephews, and lots of trips back to Pittsburgh to see family. Plus fishing. Now, he works seven days a week. The downturn has outlasted his savings, so the only money coming in is from rentals and the occasional sale of property, for below what he paid.

“I buy shoes if the old ones are worn out,” he says. “We don’t go shopping and we don’t go on vacation.”

Unlike the old Plan B, the new one doesn’t involve a lot of plane tickets. Unless you are one of the recently laid off employees of IBM, who, under a program called Project Match, can remain on the Big Blue payroll if they move to a developing country where the company has openings, like India, China or Brazil.

Worrying about the new Plan B is part of life across such a wide range of industries that it’s getting harder for anyone contemplating a leap to figure out where to land. Poonam Mahtani, who works in a Manhattan fashion house that she’d rather not identify — “Just put that I’m really happy to have a job”— says that layoffs in her field are so rampant that everyone she knows is working on Plan B.

“I’ve been thinking about business school,” she says. “Or bartending, maybe yoga instructor. I don’t know. What is safe out there?”

The new Plan B relies heavily on improvisation. Rob Hall left his job with Wachovia Securities last year when he passed on his company’s offer to relocate him from Richmond, Va., to St. Louis, as part of a restructuring. He looked at a bunch of franchising opportunities and wound up owning a mobile pet-grooming business.

“If you’d told me two years ago that I’d own an Aussie Pet Mobile, I’d have thought you were insane,” Mr. Hall says. He also started a consulting firm with a few former Wachovia friends, not all of whom were pleased that he’d taken on two very different projects. “Maybe it seemed like I was hedging my bets,” he says.

Which he was. Because in the fragile economy of the new Plan B, hatching Plan C seems like a pretty good idea.
