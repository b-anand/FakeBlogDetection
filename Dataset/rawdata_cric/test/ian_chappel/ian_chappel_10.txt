If life of late seems extremely complicated, one can at least take comfort in knowing that a lot of politicians, cricketers, and the ICC, are also feeling the pinch.

Judging by their recent record, it wouldn't be unreasonable to suggest I've committed a tautology by having "ICC" and "politicians" in the same sentence. Nevertheless, it's interesting to ponder where the ICC's problems might lead.

They have a Twenty20 bushfire raging, and spot fires breaking out on all sides: the IPL programming is creating a headache; the EPL is due to start up in competition to the Indian concept; there may be a possible player revolt over the Champions Trophy; and Zimbabwe is an ongoing crisis. The issue of Zimbabwe cricket could have been hosed down long ago, but in an effort to please everyone the ICC has compromised its integrity in one of its more shameful episodes.

The Twenty20 phenomenon needs careful management. It could be a saviour, considering the parlous state many of the Test-playing nations find themselves in. The last thing the ICC needs is an angry confrontation with many of the game's star players.

While it's easy to have sympathy for players who don't want to tour a country where terrorists are extremely active, it is equally reasonable to see the ICC's point in attempting to keep cricket vibrant in Pakistan by awarding them the Champions Trophy.

Cricket in Pakistan, once a great nursery for young talent, has been devastated by the upheaval in the country since 9/11. The last Australian side to tour there did so as as far back as 1998, and while the Australian board says it is determined to send a team to Pakistan, it is equally adamant it won't happen until their security experts deem it safe. That is about as convincing as a jockey on the merry-go-round saying, "I'd soon pass the nag in front of me if only my mount would get a move on." The Australian players, for their part, employ a similar "get out" clause when they say they will do as they have always done: be guided by the opinion of their security advisors.

It's easy to see why the Pakistan board is bemused when members of a team fall back on "the advice of security people" on the one hand but then make a personal decision to play in the IPL despite the fact that bombs regularly explode in Indian cities.

Current players quite rightly claim those of past eras didn't have to deal with the threat of deadly explosions and suicide bombers. No matter how big the paycheck, it can't be easy to placate wives and children who ask: "Why would you want to put yourself in that danger?"

Nevertheless, "the good of the game" occasionally has to figure in a player's calculations when he's faced with a difficult decision. It is not always possible to receive a considerable wage while totally avoiding all hardship, and it pays to remember that someone will want to represent his country badly enough that he will take a chance. While it goes totally against the grain of union rules, it might be best if individual players are given a conscience vote on whether or not they want to play in the Champions Trophy.

The ICC is being fair and reasonable in putting together a task force to investigate the situation in Pakistan with a view to changing the minds of players who are reluctant to tour. The fact that both India and Sri Lanka recently competed in Pakistan without any apparent security hassles during the Asia Cup should play a prominent part in those discussions.

It's fine to listen to the advice of security advisers and government officials. However, this information needs to be balanced by the fact that former Australian player Geoff Lawson coaches and lives in the country, and Imran Khan, a man of high standing in the game, among others has vouched for how sportsmen have never been targeted in Pakistan.

Perhaps once the task force has reported on the security situation in Pakistan, each cricket board could leave it to the individual players to make up their own minds about playing in the Champions Trophy. No one can be blamed for not touring Pakistan, but equally, there will be players with the nerve to accept the challenge. Once reluctant cricketers see that their country will be represented, with or without them, it could easily change their mind.

Life may be more complicated, but one thing hasn't changed; no cricketer is comfortable giving up his place to another and taking the chance the replacement player will then succeed.
