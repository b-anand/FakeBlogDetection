The cricket world has been presented with the opportunity to make up for years of indifference to a festering problem and it must do the right thing by stripping Zimbabwe of its Full Member status in the ICC. The push for such a move has come from the most unlikely quarter - the South African board, which has been among the Zimbabwe Cricket's strongest backers - and it's time the rest seized the moment.

It is, at this point, open to conjecture what led to the turnaround in the South African camp. Ray Mali, the outgoing ICC president and a known Zimbabwe Cricket sympathiser, has been unequivocal about severing South Africa's bilateral agreement with Zimbabwe, and England has been swift in calling off Zimbabwe's proposed tour in 2009. Now it is up to the ICC executive to do the obvious. It will not be a punishment; it will be doing Zimbabwe cricket a favour.

There are good reasons to keep sport and politics apart. Indeed, sport must triumph over politics. And where should the line be drawn? If an example were to be made of Zimbabwe, which has been driven to destitution and lawlessness by a dictatorial regime that refuses to honour electoral verdicts, what of China's role in suppressing democracy, or indeed that of the US and the allies in Iraq?

The point, however, is this: sport and politics have hardly stayed apart in Zimbabwe. On the contrary, politics has invaded every aspect of cricket in Zimbabwe and has driven a significant number of talented players away from the game - and, indeed, away from the country.

Racism is not a word to be used lightly but it is hardly a secret that there are almost no whites or Asians left in the game in Zimbabwe. Not that black cricketers who confronted the system have been spared. The courageous Henry Olonga now lives in exile, and the spirited Tatenda Taibu was once forced to flee the country.

But if the ICC still chooses to ignore the political situation in Zimbabwe - it ought not to - there are strong sporting reasons for it to act. On the basis of their current strength, Zimbabwe are simply not worthy of being a Full Member of the ICC. They haven't played a Test since September 2005, and their one-day team merely makes up the numbers at ICC tournaments. They even play less than the leading Associates now. Bilateral series have become rare - and not because Zimbabwe is an unsafe place to tour. The Indian board cancelled a tour for the apparent reason that playing Zimbabwe makes little commercial sense.

The reason their Test status was suspended now holds true for the shorter versions too: Zimbabwe aren't good enough to be part of the top tier. Why then must they enjoy the privileges - a seat on the executive committee, automatic entry to the World Cup, and a big share of the ICC's revenues - granted to Full Members?

Last year, which featured the World Cup, Zimbabwe's earnings from the ICC were US$11 million. It would be money well distributed if there was evidence it was wisely spent. In fact, the signs point to the opposite. An international audit firm found serious irregularities in ZC accounts, a fact acknowledged by the ICC, which has nevertheless refused to table the report so far. In comparison, the $500,000 grant to Kenya, an Associate member, is a trifle. Cricket Kenya has a right to feel short-changed.

Nothing, however, will be gained from banning Zimbabwe altogether. It will simply lead to the death of cricket in a country that once promised much. And it will condemn the cricketers, who have become mere victims of the system, to a virtual wilderness from where return might prove impossible.

What the ICC ought to do instead is to bring Zimbabwe down a notch - from Full Member to the level of an Associate - and then plot its revival. As David Morgan, the ICC president-elect, has said, the role of the Indian board will be crucial. Zimbabwe's political situation doesn't make many headlines in India and the BCCI has been content to back ZC, which in turn is happy to throw its weight behind India at board meetings.

But there is a limit to vote-bank cricket politics. In any case, the BCCI hardly needs Zimbabwe's vote to bolster its position at the ICC - its pre-eminence is now secure through its riches. Cricket needs a consensus on Zimbabwe, and true leaders think beyond themselves. It's time for India to lead a worthy cause rather than being the obstacle.

Suspending Zimbabwe's Full Member status is not only the reasonable thing to do, it is the obvious thing to do. Suspension need not mean cutting off the lifeline; it can instead mean a new lease of life. The ICC ought to put together a blueprint for the revival of Zimbabwe cricket and earmark a fund to be spent under the ICC's supervision. ZC would need to buy into this plan for it to succeed. But given that the other option is oblivion, the choice is for ZC to make.

It is said that the ICC board has some tough decisions to make regarding Zimbabwe next week. If the members are thinking right, the decision is actually fairly simple.
