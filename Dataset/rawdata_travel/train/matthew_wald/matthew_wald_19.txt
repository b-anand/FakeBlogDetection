Steve Fossett, who was the first person to complete a solo, nonstop flight around the world in a hot-air balloon and the first to fly an airplane solo around the world nonstop, died on a simple pleasure flight two years ago because he ran into a mountain downdraft, the National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday.

Mr. Fossett, 63, went missing on Sept. 3, 2007, but his remains and aircraft were not found in the Sierra Nevada of California for more than a year. His airplane, a Bellanca 8KCAB-180 called the Super Decathalon, did not carry data recorders, but investigators determined that he had run into wind blowing downward at a speed estimated at 300 feet per minute or more, at a place where the air was so thin that the plane could climb at only about 300 feet per minute.

Mr. Fossett had made a 180-degree turn in the mountains shortly before the crash, the report said.

The two-seater propeller plane was “severely fragmented” by the crash and burned in a fire so intense that surrounding pines were charred, the report stated. Investigators said they could not find evidence in the wreckage that suggested there was something wrong with the plane before the impact.

The impact of the crash destroyed an emergency radio beacon that was supposed to help searchers find crashed planes, investigators said. The Civil Air Patrol flew over the area as part of its search but did not find the wreckage. Early in the investigation, searchers found a radar track that came to an abrupt end but did not follow up because it did not correspond with the time that they believed a witness had seen the airplane; later, they revised the time of the witness’s sighting.

In October 2008, a hiker found some of Mr. Fossett’s personal items. An aerial search led to the discovery of the wreckage and bone fragments nearby, which were identified as Mr. Fossett’s through DNA analysis.
