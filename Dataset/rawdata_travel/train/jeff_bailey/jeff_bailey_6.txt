 American Airlines said that its fleet of 300 MD-80 jetliners was back to full strength on Sunday, after the cancellation of about 3,300 flights last week.

The company was still working to help passengers whose flights had been canceled and who had not yet been able to find other flights.

The flights were canceled after the Federal Aviation Administration inspected some Boeing MD-80s last Monday and found that wiring bundles had been improperly wrapped and attached inside wheel wells. American had canceled some flights two weeks earlier over the same problem.

The wiring is required to be stowed in a way to avoid chafing by moving parts in the wheel well, which could result in an electric short. American said the planes were safe all along and characterized the problem as a matter of compliance, not safety.

The F.A.A.'s inspections came after whistle-blowers at the agency said their bosses had allowed some maintenance lapses to continue at Southwest Airlines.

American has apologized for the groundings, which inconvenienced hundreds of thousands of travelers. Gerard J. Arpey, American's chief executive, said at a news conference last week that the episode would cost the company tens of millions of dollars because of refunds and hotel expenses for stranded travelers.
