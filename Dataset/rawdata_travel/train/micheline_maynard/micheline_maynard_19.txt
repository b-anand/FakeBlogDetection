American and United, the nation’s second- and third-largest airlines, said on Wednesday that their losses widened in the fourth quarter even though prices for jet fuel pulled back from record levels.

Full-year results at the two airlines flipped to losses in 2008, from profits in 2007. Each airline said it would take additional steps to cut costs in the wake of the weak economy.

American, which joined other airlines in cutting routes and flights last year in response to fuel prices, said it would eliminate more capacity this year than it originally projected.

Meanwhile, United, which began a series of job cuts in 2008, said it would eliminate 1,000 more management and executive jobs in the coming year.

Airline industry analysts have been predicting that 2009 would be a better year than 2008, one of the most difficult in recent times. For one thing, jet fuel prices, which reached a record in midsummer, have dropped 75 percent.

Meanwhile, many airlines have raised ticket prices after cutting routes and flights and retiring airplanes, which should help bolster profits.

But the struggling economy has led to a reduction in air travel, and there are doubts over how quickly it may bounce back.

“There’s a lot of uncertainty around where 2009 will take us,” said Thomas W. Horton, the chief financial officer at American. “We’re in an environment where demand is weak.”

During the fourth quarter, UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, said it lost $1.3 billion, including special charges, compared with a loss of $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.

United’s loss translated to $9.91 a share, compared with 47 cents in the quarter a year ago.

After subtracting costs related to fuel-hedging contracts and other charges, United’s loss was $555 million. Its revenue fell 9.6 percent, to $4.55 billion.

Still, the company said it would cut 1,000 more salaried and management jobs, in addition to 1,500 layoffs last year. At the beginning of 2007, United had about 9,000 salaried employees.

“These are difficult actions as they impact our people, but are the responsible steps to take in an environment of reduced capacity and demand,” United’s chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, said in an e-mail message to employees.

United announced plans last year to retire 100 aircraft, a step it expects to complete this year.

For 2008, the company lost $5.34 billion compared with a profit of $403 million in 2007.

The fourth-quarter loss at AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, was $340 million, or $1.22 a share. In the 2007 fourth quarter, American lost $69 million, or 28 cents a share. Both years were affected by special charges.

In 2008, American posted $126 million in charges related to job cuts, capacity reductions and pensions. In the 2007 quarter, it had $114 million in gains resulting from asset sales. Revenue slipped to $5.5 billion from $5.7 billion.

For the full year, American lost $2.1 billion, including special charges. Without them, the airline would have lost $1.2 billion. It earned $504 million in 2007.

American said it planned to reduce its flights by 8.5 percent during the first quarter, a percentage point more than it forecast in October. For all of 2009, American said it expected to cut flights in the United States by 9 percent, and international flights by 2.5 percent.

It attributed the additional reductions to the economy as well as a delay in deliveries of new Boeing 737 jets, because of a strike at Boeing.

The airline’s passenger traffic fell 10.4 percent in the fourth quarter, and Mr. Horton said bookings in the first quarter were running behind the same period in 2008.

American fell to second place among the nation’s airlines in October, when the merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines was completed. Delta, as the two airlines are now called, has become the nation’s biggest airline.

Shares of AMR fell nearly 24 percent on Wednesday, to $7.98, while UAL shares fell 6.1 percent, to $10.91.

Continental Airlines said Wednesday that it expects to post special charges of $170 million for the fourth quarter and $234 million for all of 2008. It said the charges would reflect costs related to its pensions, employee severance packages, the value of aircraft and losses on fuel contracts.
