 United Airlines' parent corporation said Tuesday that it lost $779 million in the third quarter, largely because of a noncash charge that reflected the declining value of its hedging contracts for jet fuel.

The loss for UAL Corporation was $6.13 a share. In the quarter a year ago, United earned $334 million, or $2.21 a share.

United recorded a $519 million charge in the quarter, reflecting the steep drop in oil prices after hitting record levels in July. United had previously disclosed its plans to take the charge.

Without the charge, United lost $252 million, or $1.99 a share. Analysts had expected a deeper third-quarter loss, and United shares rose 8.9 percent, to $13.80 in noon trading.

United's net loss, including the charge, was the largest reported thus far by the nation's airlines.

Last week, Southwest said it lost $120 million, its first loss in 17 years, because of its own charge to reflect the declining value of hedge contracts. Without the charge, Southwest earned $69 million.

AMR, the parent of American Airlines, reported a $360 million loss and Continental Airlines $145 million, while Delta Air Lines lost $26 million.

The losses at the five airlines reflect the difficulties the carriers encountered this summer in maneuvering through volatile fuel prices. The price of a barrel of oil peaked at $145 in July, but since has traded around $70 a barrel.

''While oil prices are lower in recent weeks, they continue to be volatile,'' Glenn F. Tilton, the chief executive of United, said in an e-mail message to employees.

''That said, the convergence of falling oil prices with our capacity flexibility, strong improvement on costs and competitive revenue put us in a position to make our margin and return United to profitability,'' Mr. Tilton said.

United, like other airlines, is cutting its flights in the fourth quarter and early next year. It is retiring 100 aircraft and eliminating 7,000 jobs.
