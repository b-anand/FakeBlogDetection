 GINGER ALE is an age-old remedy for sick children and grown-ups alike. Now, homemade ginger ale is appearing on drink menus across the country under happier circumstances.

In Atlanta, it is a mixer for cocktails at Drinkshop, the newly opened bar in the W Hotel Downtown developed in collaboration with Sasha Petraske, the New York-based drinks master.

Homemade ginger ale is featured at Wow Bao, a small Chicago fast-food chain that serves up Asian specialties like steamed buns and dumplings.

At Stand, a New York bar and cafe that offers a variety of traditional beverages, ginger ale is prepared to order using seltzer from old-style bottles.

Homemade sodas seem in step with the growing menu trend toward simpler, more natural foods, as well as a rising interest in locally made artisanal products, said Annika Stensson, a spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association.

''Nothing's more local than things being made from scratch,'' Ms. Stensson said.

Making things from scratch is a hallmark of a new breed of cocktail bars, too, where bartenders eschew commercial mixers in favor of those made on the spot.

Christine Sismondo of Toronto, the author of ''Mondo Cocktail,'' said the revived popularity of ginger ale was a sharp contrast to its previous reputation as a sweetener to make strong drinks more palatable. ''Rye and ginger, in Canada, was the joke drink,'' Ms. Sismondo said.

But beyond current fashions, homemade ginger ale has a lively bite that is especially appealing as summer nears.

''It's a very refreshing, vibrant feeling,'' said Geoff Alexander, the managing partner of Wow Bao, part of Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises, the Chicago restaurant company.

Typically less sweet than store-bought sodas, the handmade ales get an added zing from fresh ginger. At Stand, it is peeled and put through a strainer to make juice, said P. J. Bodoy, the general manager. The juice is steeped with lemon juice and simple syrup. When a customer orders a ginger ale, this base is topped off with seltzer delivered by Walter Backerman, a third-generation seltzer seller.

A glass of plain ginger ale costs $6. The soda also serves as an ingredient in mixed drinks, at $9 each, like the Mr. Sunshine, made with rye, and the Dark and Stormy, made with dark rum.

Mr. Petraske's ginger ale base at Drinkshop calls for lime juice instead of lemon. It is an ingredient in the slyly named Presbyterian, which includes bourbon or rum blended with ale and club soda, and topped with a twist of lemon.

Drinkshop also offers the London Buck, which has gin, ale, lemon and, in a nod to Atlanta's local fruit, peach juice. The cocktails run $13 each.

A less expensive ginger ale is sold at Sweetwaters Coffee and Tea in Ann Arbor, Mich., where a nonalcoholic drink called the Ginger Fizz costs $2.95 a serving.

The Fizz is the latest variation on the ginger-lemon tea, available hot or cold, that Sweetwaters has sold since its original branch in downtown Ann Arbor opened 15 years ago, said Lisa Bee, a co-owner. Both the tea and the ale start with a base of ginger, honey, lemon, water and an ingredient that Ms. Bee declined to identify. To make a Fizz, the concentrate is mixed with sparkling water.

Although Sweetwaters offers a variety of stronger, sweeter drinks, the Fizz's lack of sugar and caffeine are selling points. ''If we have all-natural alternatives,'' Ms. Bee said, ''people will consider them.''

Homemade ginger ale is selling well in Chicago, where the three Wow Bao shops serve 1,000 cups a week, at $2.29 apiece. The ale, made from a concentrate produced in the same kettles used to steam buns and dumplings, comes in plain, green tea and pomegranate flavors.

Wow Bao also offers the ginger concentrate at its Jackson Boulevard shop as a topping for plain frozen yogurt.

The ale fits with the restaurants' Asian theme, Mr. Alexander said. ''Ginger is a very important part of Chinese cooking,'' he said. ''It became a natural part of our menu.'' 

Though customers have suggested that Wow Bao expand its ginger ale flavorings, Mr. Alexander is reluctant to experiment too much. (A cranberry version failed to catch on.) ''We could go the full spectrum,'' he said, ''but people who want ginger ale really want ginger ale.''

Note: Ginger juice can be made with a juice extractor or purchased from most health stores and juice bars. If making a large quantity of ginger ale, ginger syrup can be prepared ahead of time by dissolving 3/4 cup sugar in 1 cup ginger juice. Add lime juice and club soda to two tablespoons syrup just before serving.
