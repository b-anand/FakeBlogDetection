THE Japanese phrase genchi genbutsu translates as “go to the spot” — in other words, “see it for yourself.” Few executives embrace that philosophy as completely as Akio Toyoda, who is slated to become the next president of the Toyota Motor Corporation.

Last summer, during a trip so secret that Toyota’s public relations staff didn’t know he was here, Mr. Toyoda visited a dealership in Ann Arbor, Mich., and decided to satisfy his curiosity about a pickup truck recall.

Still wearing his business suit, he got down on his hands and knees on the warm blacktop to examine the undercarriage of one of the trucks, shocking his American hosts, who didn’t expect a corporate V.I.P. to be so hands-on.

They, and everyone else at Toyota, had better get used to it.

In June, Mr. Toyoda will take charge of a renowned company facing its most serious setback since a crisis in the early 1950s forced his grandfather, Kiichiro Toyoda, to give up control of the carmaker he founded in 1937.

The momentum that allowed Toyota to become the world’s biggest and richest carmaker is screeching to a halt. It’s set to report billion-dollar losses for 2008, a stunning reversal from the record annual profits it earned earlier this decade.

In the United States, its biggest car market, unsold Toyotas are piling up on storage lots while dealers, once used to waiting lists of eager customers, grapple with sales that have plunged by a third.

Inside Toyota, the situation is being referred to as “the emergency,” with top management canceling routine meetings and trips to focus on overcoming a global auto slump. On Thursday, Toyota said worker buyouts, possibly shorter workweeks and executive pay reductions would be part of urgent cost-cutting.

At a news conference last month announcing his appointment, Mr. Toyoda put managers on notice that he will pop up everywhere, just as he did in Ann Arbor. “I have assumed the huge responsibility of steering Toyota at a time when we’re facing a once-in-a-century crisis,” he said. “Given the circumstances, I take my responsibility very seriously.”

All of this is far more challenging than anyone at Toyota anticipated even a year ago. Early this month, Toyota forecast a $3.9 billion net loss for the 2008 fiscal year, which ends in March, the first time it has lost money since 1950. It expects an even deeper operating loss of about $5 billion, its first since it was founded.

The dismal financial news came only days after Toyota confirmed rumors that Mr. Toyoda, after a 25-year apprenticeship, would finally become its next president, replacing Katsuaki Watanabe, who has held the job since 2005, and who will become vice chairman.

The prospect of deep losses and the abrupt announcement that a Toyoda would return to power, after people from outside the family had run the company for 14 years, have jolted the auto giant in the same way that looming bankruptcy has rattled Detroit automakers.

“The financial crisis and the economy are intertwined, and the crisis is expanding significantly faster, wider and deeper than we expected,” Mr. Watanabe wrote in an e-mail message in response to questions.

Even before Mr. Watanabe hands off the top job at the company to Mr. Toyoda, pieces of Toyota’s response to the crisis are being rolled out.

Toyota, which has been on a steep growth curve this decade, has put new plants on hold, including a factory under construction in Blue Springs, Miss., that was supposed to open next year. The company plans to cut spending by 10 percent and is letting many temporary workers go; permanent workers thus far have been protected by a lifetime employment policy.

Toyota is also rethinking its lineup of cars for every region of the world and accelerating offerings of more environmentally friendly vehicles. And it’s already planning for 2030, when it envisions a world in which hybrid vehicles — and other types, like those that run on hydrogen — dominate the roads as traditional internal combustion engines fade in importance.

Toyota doesn’t plan to seek government support, either in Japan or elsewhere, Mr. Watanabe said. That fact alone illustrates the gap between Toyota and its American counterparts.

“G.M., Ford and Chrysler are trying to survive,” says John Paul MacDuffie, an associate professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “All Toyota is trying to do is survive a downturn.”

To do so, Toyota will rely on someone who has been groomed for this job for much of his adult life.

ALONG with his last name, reminders of Mr. Toyoda’s heritage are ubiquitous in Japan. A bust of his look-alike grandfather sits in front of Toyota’s soaring glass headquarters in Toyota City, about 30 miles outside Nagoya.

Toyota believes alternative cars, like the Prius hybrid, above, will dominate the roads by 2030.

The original office building where Toyota was founded is near Nagoya’s bustling train station, while the traditional Japanese home of the company patriarch, Sakichi Toyoda, is on display in Toyoda City.

These days, the Toyoda family — which spelled its companies’ names differently so they would be easier to write in Japanese characters — holds only a small fraction of Toyota stock.

But the family still wields a powerful influence at Toyota. Mr. Toyoda insists that nepotism was not behind his elevation, and he is also quick to point out that he is captive to his family’s legacy.

“I really did not have a choice to be born with the Toyoda surname,” he said on the day he was named as Toyota’s next president.

Even if his last name were different, Mr. Toyoda’s appointment would set him apart, however. At 52, he is still relatively young to become a Japanese chief executive. (Mr. Watanabe, who turned 67 on Friday, was 63 when he was promoted.)

Mr. Toyoda is fluent in English, perfected when he earned his M.B.A. at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., and during the years he spent in New York, working as an investment banker and management consultant and living around the corner from the Frick Collection.

Unlike other Japanese executives, who rely on interpreters even when they understand a foreign language, Mr. Toyoda is content to operate in English, using it in speeches, interviews and, according to Professor MacDuffie, even at the training programs that Wharton conducts in Japan.

At one recent Wharton session, Mr. Toyoda cracked jokes and eschewed a formal presentation for an off-the-cuff talk. He seemed “very much a part of the younger generation,” Professor MacDuffie said.

Not surprisingly, Toyota’s American executives, who are struggling with their deepest sales decline in a generation, can’t wait for him to take charge.

“Akio is a very, very good leader,” says James Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., the company’s sales arm here. “He’s passionate about the company, and passionate about the people at the company.”

Mr. Lentz met Mr. Toyoda in 1995, when he was general manager of Toyota’s San Francisco region, and Mr. Toyoda was a planner and administrator at a plant in Fremont, Calif., that was a joint venture with General Motors.

Late one Friday night, there was a quiet knock on Mr. Lentz’s office door. Not expecting a guest, he opened it to find Mr. Toyoda, who had come from Fremont to pick up a car to use for the weekend.

Mr. Lentz got another surprise when he discovered that Mr. Toyoda was accompanied by his father, Shoichiro, then Toyota’s chairman, who had traveled to America, unannounced, to visit his son.

Drop-ins continue to be part of Mr. Toyoda’s routine. In recent months, he has frequently called on Mark Templin, the general manager of Toyota’s Lexus luxury division, and one of the company’s most prominent American leaders, to discuss the future of Lexus.

In January, Toyota announced that Lexus would develop its first vehicle to be exclusively designed as a hybrid. Mr. Templin hinted that other dedicated hybrids, and perhaps a premium small car like the Mini Cooper, also may be in store for Lexus.

Mr. Templin, who regularly visits Mr. Toyoda in Japan, describes the Toyota headquarters desk of his boss as “full of paper.” Mr. Toyoda’s office is much smaller than those favored by American chief executives, says Mr. Templin, who adds that he has been impressed by Mr. Toyoda’s effort over decades to learn all aspects of the company’s operations.

Along with his assignment at the Fremont joint venture, Mr. Toyoda has run Toyota’s operations in China and Japan and started a Web site aimed at young Japanese consumers called Gazoo.com. The site, originally meant as a way to market Toyota’s used cars, has since morphed into a popular social network.

Mr. Toyoda was named to the company board in 2000, which put him in regular contact with all of Toyota’s senior leaders, and joined their ranks in 2005, when he became an executive vice president. (The ascent hasn’t been without a few glitches. Not long after becoming a board member, Mr. Toyoda lost the gold lapel pin bearing the original Toyota emblem that all directors wear each day. His status as a family member won him no special treatment, he confided last year in an interview: like everyone else, he had to pay for a replacement.)
