TWO decades ago, when navigation systems were an automotive novelty, it seemed cool enough to have a device in your car that told you how to get from point A to point B.

Its stern voice instructing, “When possible, make a legal U-turn,” guaranteed hours of amusement for young children or tipsy friends.

But navigation systems have become more than a way to get directions using the Global Positioning System. Like iPhones and Blackberrys, they are becoming tools for running your life — a combination of Yellow Pages and travel guides, music players and traffic avoidance systems.

“It’s becoming an in-car computer where navigation is only one of the things it does,” said Brian Moody, the road test editor with Edmunds.com, which offers automotive advice.

Mr. Moody, who recently tested navigation devices for the site, uses his own portable unit for a multitude of purposes, including traffic reports, weather information and movie times, and for storing music files.

He often totes headphones in his travel bag and plugs them into his navigation device to listen to his latest downloads. “At first, it seems like kind of a dumb idea,” Mr. Moody said. “I have an iPod, I have a stereo in my car, why would I want that?”

But he said he began to appreciate having the option of traveling with fewer devices — even if he ended up taking all of them with him anyway.

Nationally, car navigation devices have become a huge business. In 2007, sales topped $2.5 billion, according to Frost & Sullivan, an automotive technology consulting firm.

About 75 percent of those systems were portable units that can be moved from car to car; prices range from $300 to $1,200. Installed systems generally range from about $1,200 to $3,000, depending on the vehicle and the option package that includes the navigation system.

The advent of portable systems has been a great leveler, Mr. Moody said. No longer does a consumer have to purchase a high-end luxury car or an expensive S.U.V. to get access to G.P.S. technology. With a portable system, “I can get the same thing on my ’81 Corolla,” Mr. Moody said. “Now you can have a $16,000 car with the features of a $40,000 Lexus.”

Increasingly those units, whether portable or installed, come with databases of information that go far beyond simple maps.

For the past few years, for example, Honda has provided access to restaurant, hotel and other recommendations from the Zagat guides through the navigation systems it offers on vehicles like the Accord sedan and its Acura luxury cars.

Magellan and Garmin, major manufacturers of G.P.S. units, offer travel information in some models. Magellan’s is provided by the American Automobile Association, Garmin’s by Fodor’s.

Mr. Moody predicts that more such tie-ins between guidebooks, advice companies and ratings surveys lie ahead.

JoAnn Barrett, a real estate agent in Ann Arbor, Mich., was rescued by her navigation system during a recent business trip. Traveling by car from Chicago to Kansas City, Mo., Ms. Barrett decided to stop for the night in Iowa, but had no motel reservation and no sense of her surroundings. “It was raining so hard I could hardly see 20 feet in front of the car,” she said.

So Ms. Barrett consulted her portable navigation device, conducting a search for motels close to her location, and then called to check availability and rates. “I found a vacancy at a nice motel owned by a Michigan fan,” Ms. Barrett said.

Robert W. Mann Jr. of Port Washington, N.Y., an aviation industry consultant, uses his Hewlett Packard iPaq 610 model to find the nearest Starbucks after dropping off his children at sports events in distant towns. Mr. Mann, who admits to having a lead foot when he’s behind the wheel, has set his iPaq to warn him when the car’s speed exceeds 80 miles per hour. Once, on a plane trip, he forgot to turn off the device, only to have an alarm sound as the aircraft was accelerating down the runway.

Before buying the portable iPaq four years ago, Mr. Mann relied on maps and other information that he printed out from his computer before a trip. “I carried around a lot of sheets of paper, but not all of them were useful,” he said.

If a navigation system has a Bluetooth connection to a cellular phone, it’s possible to call up a listing, push a button and connect to the listing in just a few seconds.

Navigation systems can provide plenty of amusement — a search for “Elvis” in Tupelo, Miss., Presley’s birthplace, turned up 16 locations with his first name in their title.

Navigation systems also can be useful in making discoveries, even in familiar surroundings. Although she likes to think she knows the Ann Arbor area well, Ms. Barrett said she frequently checks her navigation device for a faster way from one real estate listing to the next.

Mr. Mann said he realized how much he had come to depend on his iPaq when he accidentally left it in a cab during a visit to Chicago to meet with an airline executive. “Literally, as I walked in his office, I realized I had lost it,” he said.

Mr. Mann called the cab company and asked to have the driver return if he found the device. An hour later, as he was leaving the meeting, he was told that the cabby was in the lobby, iPaq in hand. The driver seemed delighted to have helped Mr. Mann, who tipped him $100 for returning the device. “My whole life was in there — appointment calendar, files, everything,” he said. “I don’t know what I would have done if I had lost it.”
