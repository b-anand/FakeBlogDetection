IN the 20 years since Toyota opened its first plant in the United States, its reputation as a corporate philanthropist has grown along with its vehicle sales.

Its gifts have ranged from cash grants for education groups to minivans for Special Olympics West Virginia to allowing farmland near its Indiana assembly plant to be used by local chapters of the National FFA Association, or Future Farmers of America.

Now, with the Detroit auto companies scaling back charitable donations after a slump in car sales, Toyota, which expects to earn $5.5 billion worldwide this year, has emerged as an alternative source of money, even though it is experiencing the same slowdown that has hit American carmakers. Still, it continues to make donations, even in those companies’ backyard.

In 2007, Toyota, which has five plants in the United States and is set to open a sixth in 2010 in Blue Springs, Miss., donated $57 million to schools, arts organizations, environmental groups and other American charities. Among those donations: $2 million to the Detroit Science Center for a new theater, set to open in December, that will showcase the stories of engineers for students.

Toyota’s contributions have continued this year with its largest ever, a $20 million donation to the National Audubon Society for environmental programs. And, when it opened a safety and engineering center in York Township, Mich., last month, Toyota donated $100,000 to two local school systems, a park and Michigan’s economic development fund.

“I don’t think there’s any way we can supplant what the Big Three are doing,” said James E. Wiseman, vice president of external affairs for Toyota. “There’s no way we can cover for them if their giving drops significantly, but we’re trying to do our part, and then some.”

Indeed, the Detroit companies’ shortfall would leave a big gap.

The Ford Motor Company Fund spent $37.7 million in 2006, the latest year for which figures are available, ranking it 18th among corporate funds, according to the Foundation Center, which tracks corporate giving. That same year, the General Motors Foundation spent $29.4 million, making it 21st on the center’s list. (Toyota did not appear on the list in 2006.)

But Toyota’s gifts have not always been perfectly well-received.

Its grant to Audubon, earmarked for a five-year program called TogetherGreen, generated a flurry of debate on the Internet. Toyota said the money would pay for education programs, nature centers and a volunteer effort.

But after the donation was announced, it turned out that the society was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the National Park Service, accusing it of failing to regulate driving on the beaches at Cape Hatteras National Seashore in North Carolina.

A company spokesman, Mike Michels, said the money could be used only for programs Toyota had designated, not funneled to legal action.

Nonetheless, there were sharply worded messages on the company’s Open Road Blog. Many suggested that Audubon might use the money to penalize Toyota customers who owned sport utility vehicles that could be driven on North Carolina beaches and those elsewhere.

Toyota prefers that its donations have a friendlier effect. Ever since it opened its first American factory in Georgetown, Ky., in 1986, the automaker has emphasized the need to be a good neighbor to the towns and states where it does business.

That philosophy was expressed to Mr. Wiseman, then in charge of public relations at the plant, in an hourlong conversation with Kaneyoshi Kusunoki, the executive sent from Japan to serve as the factory’s chairman.

Toyota’s first donation, announced when the plant was dedicated, paid to renovate a community center in Georgetown. Since then, it has spent about $400 million on donations to American organizations, Mr. Wiseman said.

Given the difficulties facing Detroit companies, as well as financial institutions that have long been active in philanthropy, Toyota has emerged as a company that still has money to spend.

“People do swamp us,” Mr. Wiseman said. “We get far more good requests than we can possibly say yes to.”

The company is selective about the causes it backs. For instance, although it has long been a supporter of the Japan Society in New York, Mr. Wiseman said the company was not interested in supporting programs just because of a Japanese connection.

Nor does Toyota want to become involved in local political issues, like proposals to raise taxes to pay for parks near factories.

Although that might fit Toyota’s environmental bent, Mr. Wiseman said some Toyota employees might take offense if the company was involved.

Instead, Toyota has prioritized donations to education programs, followed by arts and environmental organizations and groups that encourage diversity.

It supports umbrella organizations like United Way and participates in community campaigns like the Fine Arts Fund in Cincinnati, near Toyota’s manufacturing and engineering headquarters in Erlanger, Ky.

Toyota’s American employees are also encouraged to volunteer, and some have appeared on billboards promoting community involvement.

Mr. Wiseman said that in 2005 Toyota felt it had to challenge unfounded Web reports that the company had failed to help New Orleans and other cities battered by Hurricane Katrina. Two weeks after the storm, Toyota announced it had given $5 million to organizations like the American Red Cross, and that its dealers also had participated.

“Rumors started over the Internet that Toyota hadn’t given anything, and in fact we had given millions,” Mr. Wiseman said. “We wanted to head that off.”

He also said Toyota believed its public service activities could pay off in the marketplace.

“We try not to overdo it, but we want to do it to a certain extent because the people who buy our cars and trucks are increasingly interested in whether we are trying to be good public citizens,” he said. “We wouldn’t want to be doing all this to hide our light under a bushel.”
