MOTOWN and Stax. Say the names and a music lover’s head instantly fills with melodies, like “Dancing in the Streets,” by Martha and the Vandellas, or “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay,” by Otis Redding.

MOTOWN MEMORIES In Detroit, the record label’s museum includes the white house known as Hitsville where singers like Stevie Wonder recorded in Studio A.

Now, half a century after each was founded, the labels live on in their hometowns, one an industrial city up north, another a river city in the South.

The Motown Historical Museum in Detroit, which celebrates its 24th anniversary this year, when Motown Records is celebrating its 50th, includes a tiny white house known as Hitsville, where singers were discovered by Berry Gordy and trained by studio executives to become the hottest thing in music.

The house, where groups like the Four Tops and the Temptations and artists like Stevie Wonder recorded their greatest hits, is a time capsule of the glory years of Motown.

By contrast, the Stax Museum of American Soul Music, about 10 minutes from downtown Memphis, cannot make such a claim.

The original studios of Stax Records, home to artists like the Staple Singers, Sam and Dave, and Booker T. and the MGs, are long gone, torn down in 1989 by a church that had taken over the deserted buildings on McLemore Avenue.

So the museum’s founders had to start from scratch.

Instead of simply recreating the empty theater that served as the label’s studio, organizers built a new museum, with a wide variety of exhibits dedicated to all types of American soul artists, not just those who recorded with Stax.

The grounds of the 11-year-old museum are also shared by the Soulsville Charter School, home to after-school programs that predate the museum, as well as a summer music camp.

Given their respective impacts on American music, it almost would seem like the two should switch places, with Motown, still operating today as part of Universal Music Group, getting the bigger quarters and Stax, which went out of business in 1975, housed in something less expansive.

“Musically, Stax was grittier, and clearly more Southern, whereas Motown had an overarching corporate philosophy of making music for all people,” said Howard Kramer, a curator at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, which recently opened an exhibit marking the Motown anniversary.

But Stax enjoyed a revival of sorts two years ago, when it celebrated its golden anniversary. Now it is Motown’s turn to celebrate, putting the spotlight on Hitsville, as Motown Records’ headquarters was called.

“Everybody wants to be our friend this year, and that’s fine, we’ll let them,” said Robin Terry, the museum’s executive director.

Ms. Terry, 40, is part of the extended Motown family, the great-niece of Mr. Gordy and granddaughter of Esther Gordy Edwards, Mr. Gordy’s sister. Ms. Terry recalls visits from “Uncle Smokey” (Robinson) when she was a child and putting on her pajamas to slide down the stairs of Mr. Gordy’s Detroit mansion.

After Mr. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972, Ms. Terry’s grandmother stayed behind in Detroit, where one office remained open in one of the eight houses that had been its headquarters.

Mrs. Edwards served as an informal preservationist of the label’s roots, collecting more than 500,000 pieces of Motown memorabilia.

Fans would regularly knock on her door, asking to visit the original studio and offices. Finally, in 1985, Mrs. Edwards persuaded her brother to let her turn Hitsville into a museum.

Ms. Terry took over in 2002, overseeing a collection that includes a fraction of the objects that Motown owns (and which are kept in an undisclosed warehouse). There is a single case of costumes worn by the Supremes, a set of sky blue and turquoise dresses that show perspiration stains from the workout the women received on stage.

A hat and glove donated by Michael Jackson take up another display case, while a piano used to teach Motown artists sits in a corner, its keys covered with masking tape, spelling out each note. Another exhibit features Mr. Gordy’s apartment, furnished with no-frills period pieces, while a candy machine, with prices and snacks from the 1960s, stands nearby.

But the centerpiece of Hitsville is Studio A.

Here, visitors can see the control booth where songwriters like Lamont Dozier and the brothers Brian and Edward Holland sat scribbling as musicians belted out takes of their songs a few steps below.

The floor of the studio — most recently featured in a video by Kid Rock — is worn from use by artists like Marvin Gaye and Levi Stubbs, lead singer of the Four Tops, who died last year.

“It’s an authentic Motown experience,” said Ms. Terry. “There’s no place else in the world where you can go and stand in the steps of musical icons — play the piano that Stevie Wonder played and stand at David Ruffin’s microphone. We’re allowing people to relive that.”

On a recent morning, Jennifer Lim and Dmitri Della Faille, both of Toronto, stopped by the studio during a trip to Detroit for a martial arts tournament. “If you are going to Detroit, it is something you cannot avoid,” said Mr. Della Faille.

“It’s a hidden treasure,” added Ms. Lim.

Still, the authentic surroundings can’t mask the feeling that there ought to be more on display here, given Motown’s impact on music and its hometown. “People pull up to Hitsville and say, ‘That’s Motown?’ ” Ms. Terry conceded.

Indeed, there have been a number of efforts through the years to move the Motown Museum to bigger digs.

In 1999, for example, plans were announced to house the museum in the empty office building on Woodward Avenue where Mr. Gordy moved Motown’s operations after they outgrew the original quarters.

But that effort never came to fruition, and now the building is gone. Kwame Kilpatrick, then Detroit’s mayor, ordered it torn down on the eve of the 2006 Super Bowl, which was held in the city, declaring it to be an eyesore.

Ms. Terry hasn’t given up, and in the meantime, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame set up its own Motown exhibit this year. None of the objects were lent by Motown, however; instead, they came from the collection owned by Universal, which acquired it when a chain of Motown-themed cafes went out of business.

“Motown is a subject that could easily cover 5,000 square feet,” Mr. Kramer said. “We knew we couldn’t do that much, but we tried to give an overview.”

On display are stage costumes from Mr. Gaye and his singing partner, Tammi Terrell; a bass guitar owned by Rick James; a passport that belonged to Mr. Ruffin, the lead singer of The Temptations; and posters for appearances by Motown artists.

“It was an incredible statement of black economic power,” Mr. Kramer said of Motown. “It showed the almost absurd amount of talent from Detroit. There may have been more talent in other cities, but Berry Gordy did a better job of getting it out there.”

When it comes to museum exhibits, however, Memphis now seems to have the upper hand. Soulsville is part of a community of music-related attractions that are enough to occupy visitors for a week.

They include Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley, as well as Sun Records, his original label. Meanwhile, Gibson offers a tour of its guitar factory downtown, just a block south of Beale Street, where numerous bars feature live bands playing tunes from the Stax era.

Soulsville also benefits from its association with the National Civil Rights Museum, housed at the Lorraine Motel, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968 (the two sell a combination ticket that offers a discount from each museum’s admission price).

Inside Soulsville, there are enough displays and objects to interest even those who could not name a tune by Rufus Thomas or Jean Knight, two artists who recorded for Stax.

After watching an introductory film, visitors see the first exhibit, a 100-year-old gospel church from Duncan, Miss., which was dismantled and installed at the insistence of Al Bell, the former chairman of Stax. He said the museum needed to teach visitors that the roots of soul music lay in Southern churches.

The rooms of exhibits include soul artists on other labels, like Aretha Franklin and Ike and Tina Turner, and also focus on some of Stax’s biggest names, especially Mr. Redding and Isaac Hayes, who won an Oscar for best song with the theme for the 1971 movie “Shaft.”

Mr. Hayes, who died last year, gave the museum a custom-built Cadillac and an organ, which sits in the lobby.

The museum draws about 45,000 visitors a year, while the charter school and after-school program educate hundreds of Memphis children annually.

Although the museum is in a worn-looking working-class neighborhood, Tim Sampson, one of the museum’s founders, said that did not deter visitors. They come from 26 countries and every continent but Antarctica. “And I’m working on that,” he said.

In Detroit, Ms. Terry is busy with plans for Motown’s 50th anniversary year. One highlight will be a gala this fall featuring Motown artists, although she is not sure she will even try to top the label’s 25th anniversary celebration, which was broadcast on national television.

“For us, it’s a special time to respect this legacy,” she said of Hitsville. “It’s such a tough time right now, in the city and in the state. It’s nice to reflect on something positive. You really can hold your head up high.”
