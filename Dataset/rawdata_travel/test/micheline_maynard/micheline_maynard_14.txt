Delta Air Lines, the nation’s biggest carrier, said Wednesday that it would charge some passengers to check their first bag, but that it was eliminating the fuel surcharges to book tickets using frequent-flier miles.

Delta, whose merger with Northwest Airlines took place last week, was the last holdout among major airlines in charging a first-bag fee.

It said it was adopting the fee as it matched its policies with Northwest, which was among the airlines charging to check luggage.

“Delta is adopting proven practices from both Delta and Northwest that have been broadly accepted in the marketplace,” said Stephen Gorman, a Delta executive vice president and the airline’s chief operating officer.

Shares of Delta fell 7 percent, to $10.48.

The airline said it planned to charge $15 for checking the first bag, and $25 for a second bag, for passengers traveling within the United States. The new second-bag fee is half what Delta had charged.

The fee takes effect Dec. 5, and will primarily affect passengers flying on discount economy-class tickets.

Delta said passengers who had already bought tickets for travel on or after Dec. 5 would be charged the old rate, $50, for a second bag. And those travelers would be allowed to check one bag at no charge, as Delta has been doing.

Passengers in first or business class and those who have achieved elite status on either Delta or Northwest will be allowed to check three bags without paying a fee. Passengers flying on full coach fares and passengers on international flights can check two bags without an additional charge.

Meanwhile, Delta said it was dropping surcharges of $25 to $100 that it had been assessing for booking frequent-flier tickets at either Delta or Northwest. The move is effective immediately. Delta had described the step as a temporary measure in the aftermath of record oil prices, which reached $145 a barrel in July. Oil has traded recently at half that price.

Delta said it would also install a “coach choice” program, like the one at Northwest. It allows passengers to select seats in certain parts of the plane, like the aisle, window or exit rows, for fees of $5 to $25, depending on the location of the seats and destination of their flights.

It said elite members of the frequent-flier programs would still be able to select the seats without charge.

Delta said passengers should continue to check in at the airline where they bought their ticket. It expects to combine the two airlines’ operations completely over the next 12 to 24 months.
