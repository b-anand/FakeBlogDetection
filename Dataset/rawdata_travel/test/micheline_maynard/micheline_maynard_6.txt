The Toyota Motor Company is exploring a reorganization of its North American operations that would put its sales, engineering and manufacturing operations under one executive, people with direct knowledge of the plan said Thursday.

The new organization, which has not yet been completed, may be led by a returning executive, Yoshimi Inaba, who spent years in the United States and was once considered a candidate to become Toyota’s president, the equivalent of chief executive.

If Toyota decides to reorganize, it would be the first significant step by the incoming president, Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the company founder, Kiichiro Toyoda.

Mr. Toyoda takes charge in June, when Toyota holds its annual shareholders’ meeting.

That is also the time when a new organization could be announced, the people with knowledge of the plan said. They insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about it.

The news was first reported Wednesday by The Detroit News. Toyota executives did not comment.

The idea of an umbrella North American organization has been debated for some time inside Toyota, whose operations in the United States and Canada were assembled over the years.

The company began selling cars in the United States in 1957, working from a headquarters in California. It added a technical center in Ann Arbor, Mich.; a manufacturing headquarters in Erlanger, Ky.; a corporate office in New York; and a government affairs office in Washington.

Each has its own staff and set of executives, which has led to duplication at a time when Toyota, like other global auto companies, is striving to cut costs. The automaker is expected to announce a $3.5 billion loss for the fiscal year that ended March 31, and its sales in the United States this year are down 37 percent compared with 2008.

Mr. Toyoda, 52, has vowed to get off to a fast start and address the duplication, so the appointment of Mr. Inaba to a North American role would be in line with his approach.

But there is debate within Toyota about the need for an umbrella organization. Some North American executives have argued that their operations ultimately report back to executives in Japan, so adding another layer in North America might further slow decision-making.

Even if Mr. Inaba were to reorganize, it may not be as dramatic as most American-style restructuring plans, said Jeffrey K. Liker, a professor of engineering at the University of Michigan and the author of several books on the company. He said Toyota lays offs workers only as a last resort, relying instead on buyouts and voluntary retirement programs.

“If that was not the case, it would be a whole lot easier to just down size like any other company,” Professor Liker said. “They have to be much more thoughtful and creative about how they use people, and right now they have a lot of extra people.”

There has also been some concern about creating a job so powerful as the one Mr. Inaba might hold, given that Toyota has long played down individual roles in favor of its consensus philosophy.

Still, Mr. Inaba would need no tutoring in the North American industry. Early this decade, he served as president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., the company’s top American sales job, and ran its operations in China before leaving Toyota in 2007 to run a new airport in Nagoya, Japan, the location of Toyota’s worldwide headquarters.

Fluent in English, Mr. Inaba had long predicted Mr. Toyoda would be named to the company’s top job, and his return to the company this spring was a sign that Mr. Toyoda wanted his counsel during a difficult period.

During a 2003 interview, Mr. Inaba foresaw the problems that Toyota would face as it tried to continue its growth. “It will not be as easy as it has been,” Mr. Inaba said. “This phase is a little different.”
