WITH the travel industry reeling, it’s not hard to find a vacation bargain. But for American travelers, some of the deepest discounts are Down Under.

A number of factors are making Australia look like a steal this summer. Just as the winter season in Australia is starting, the United States dollar has gained close to 25 percent over the last year against the Australian dollar, to 1.27 Australian dollars, bolstering Americans’ buying power. On top of that, resorts from Uluru to Melbourne are offering discounts of as much 30 percent to lure guests amid the travel slump.

And airfare — one of the biggest expenses of any trip to Australia — has been slashed thanks to new entrants in the trans-Pacific air travel market.

“There will probably never be a better time to visit Australia in your lifetime,” said Robbert J. van Bloemendaal, the Australian-born president of the Travel Leaders office in Rowlett, Tex. “Last year, the best you could do, depending on the season, was about $900 with a normal discount economy fare, to about $1,500” for a round-trip fare. This year, he said, he has seen one-way fares “as low as $299.”

While fares have been running slightly higher in recent weeks, he added, prices are still “nowhere near last year.”

Qantas and United Airlines, which have long dominated the market with nonstop routes between the United States and Australia, are facing fresh competition from V Australia, a new airline from Richard Branson’s Virgin Blue Group. It began flying daily between Los Angeles and Sydney in February with nonstop round-trip flights from $729.

In April, V Australia added three flights a week between Los Angeles and Brisbane, with rates from $738. It plans to add another route, to Melbourne, in September. And come July 1, Delta will add its first daily nonstop between Los Angeles and Sydney.

All of this new competition has forced Qantas and United to answer with fare cuts. A recent online search turned up nonstop round-trip fares from the West Coast to Australia in July as low as $690 on United and $790 on Qantas, including taxes and fees, and $864 from Newark on United, with a stop in San Francisco.

Once on land, the savings continue. Rooms at Quest Potts Point, formerly the Storrier, in Sydney, start at 165 Australian dollars, or about $130, down from about $175 last June, when rates began at 185 local dollars a night.

One- and two-bedroom timber cabins at the Jemby Rinjah Eco Lodge in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales start at 170 dollars a night for two adults and two children under 12, or about $133. And the Majestic Roof Garden Hotel in Adelaide is offering a special rate of 165 dollars, with breakfast, down from about 180 normally.

Jetting around the country has also gotten cheaper. Qantas has been offering its Aussie AirPass, which includes an international round-trip ticket and three domestic Australian flights for as low as $999. Virgin Blue is offering its own air-pass deal from 69 Australian dollars a flight.

Package deals that combine airfare, hotel and sightseeing are yielding some of the best bargains. Qantas, for example, has been advertising $999 summer package deals that include six nights in Sydney, admission to the city’s aquarium and a flight from Los Angeles or San Francisco.

V Australia has been offering four-night Brisbane Getaways in conjunction with Sunspots International, a South Pacific wholesale company, for $986 a person. The package includes a night at the budget Hotel George Williams in Brisbane and three nights at the Islander Resort Hotel on the Gold Coast.

Many individual tour operators are also passing savings on to travelers.

Swain Tours, a major seller of South Pacific travel on the East Coast, has slashed its 15-day Australian Experience by $600, to $1,635 a person based on double occupancy. The trip includes round-trip airfare from Los Angeles or San Francisco, internal flights and four nights each in Melbourne, Cairns and Sydney.

And AAT Kings has slashed rates on 13-day tours by $642 a couple, to $3,959 for “last minute” Tropical Discovery tours in July, which visit Fraser Island, Brampton Island and the Great Barrier Reef.

International visitor arrivals were expected to fall by 4.1 percent this year, according to the latest forecast from Tourism Australia, made in December. This would be the worst drop since 1989, when a pilots’ strike constricted travel.

The country, which relies heavily on tourism, is aggressively marketing its vacation value with a campaign linked to the movie “Australia.” The film’s director, Baz Luhrmann, also produced a weighty tourism video, in which a stressed-out Manhattanite on the verge of a breakup is visited by an Aboriginal youth who magically transports her to Australia. There, in a “walkabout,” she presumably reconnects with herself and her partner.

Melodrama aside, the campaign cuts straight to the wallet, with a range of vacation offers aimed at Americans, like a six-night Wine and Wilderness Retreat from $1,885 a person, including flights, hotels and a rental car.

The tourism agency has also created an interactive price comparison widget that travel sellers have been using to demonstrate how far the United States dollar goes in Australia compared with Europe. A pint of beer: $3 in Australia versus $7 in Britain, it notes; a city tour: $27 in Sydney versus $38 in London. (And those prices reflect the higher exchange rates of last fall.)

New Zealand, where the United States dollar has been buying about 1.60 local dollars, is also trying to bank on its increasing affordability with comparisons to Europe. “Compared to a holiday in the U.K. or Europe, it’s like getting a champagne vacation on a beer budget,” states its tourism Web site,.

Australian Pacific Touring is offering savings of up to $1,540 a couple for trips booked by June 30 for travel in October and November. And Qantas has been offering fares from New York to Auckland from $960 a round trip, and $1,010 to Wellington, Christchurch or Queensland.

While it’s technically winter in the Southern Hemisphere when its summer in the United States, temperatures are mild all year in much of Australia. And its northern destinations, including the Great Barrier Reef and the Northern Territory, rich in Aboriginal culture, are especially popular in June, July and August.

But if you want to visit the Outback at these low rates, don’t wait too long. Tourism Australia says that its global campaign has already helped drive bookings, and that traffic at its site, Australia.com, has jumped significantly in recent months.

Mr. van Bloemendaal of Travel Leaders warns, “Prices will go up as the economy improves, and these specials will be a memory.”
