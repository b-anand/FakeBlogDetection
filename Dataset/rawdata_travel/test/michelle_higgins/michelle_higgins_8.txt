THERE may be no better time to visit Mexico than now. It’s been about a month since swine flu scares sent tourists fleeing, but with new cases of the H1N1 virus on the wane, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted its ban on nonessential travel to Mexico on May 15. Museums, restaurants and historic sites are largely back in business. And resorts from Los Cabos to Cancún, which saw occupancy plummet by more than 50 percent at the end of April and the beginning of May, are beckoning with discounts of up to 70 percent.

The perennially popular Maya Tulum Wellness Retreat & Spa, which normally doesn’t have to discount, is offering summer rates from $1,368 a person for its seven-night Mind, Body and Spirit Package through October, including three meals a day, spa treatments, daily yoga sessions and nature tours; guests in June or July get an extra 30 percent off that. At the very high end, Rosewood’s popular Ventanas al Paraíso in Los Cabos has cut already discounted summer rates for its three-night Escapes package to $515 a night and is adding extras like free upgrades and $200 in resort credit.

Intense cleaning efforts are under way at hotels and resorts, and hand sanitizers are on display. Some chains are even offering flu-free guarantees. Through June, Real Resorts is offering to pay the medical bills of any guest who comes down with the virus within seven days of visiting one of its resorts, as well as a free future vacation. AM Resorts is promising three free vacations over the next three years to guests who contract H1N1 while staying at its Secrets or Dreams chains.

Cheap airfare is easy to find. Rates for nonstop round-trip flights from New York were as low as $270 to Cancún and $280 to Mexico City in recent online searches; and Los Angeles to Los Cabos was about $250. Apple Vacations, a major seller of trips to Mexico, recently announced round-trip airfare from Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas and elsewhere for as low as $199 round trip.

Major airlines have also lifted low-fare travel restrictions on tickets to Mexico well into peak winter season. “Many popular routes such as to Cancún and Mexico City now have low fares with no advance purchase requirement and are valid for travel through a 330-day period,” said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com.

Meanwhile, as Mexico is aggressively trying to win back tourists, competing resorts in Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean are trying to position themselves as alternative vacation spots for travelers still wary of Mexico. Couples Resorts is hoping a new 50 percent-off promotion will persuade some travelers to change their destination to Jamaica. Others, like Little Dix Bay on Virgin Gorda, which without marketing picked up more than 200 room reservations in May, have been benefiting from travelers looking for alternatives to Mexico.

But the bargains for Mexican vacations are hard to beat. “The bottom line is Mexico is on sale and offering incredible specials to lure people back,” said Sallie Rawlings, a spokeswoman for Travel Impressions, a major tour operator to Mexico.

CANCÙN-RIVIERA MAYA

All-inclusive resorts up and down Mexico’s east coast are slashing rates and adding perks. Grand Velas All Suites & Spa Resort near Playa del Carmen is offering a Welcome Back to Mexico automatic double upgrade deal through June. That means guests who book a regular suite for $300 a person a night are upgraded to an Ambassador Pool Suite, with a plunge pool, normally $630 a person a night.

And Real Resorts has cut rates to about $268 a night for two at the Royal in Cancún, from $485. Karisma Resorts and Hotels is offering up to $400 in airfare credits to guests who book four-night air-inclusive vacation packages by June 8.

LOS CABOS

Bargains abound in this popular, upscale resort community at the tip of Baja California, which suddenly finds itself desperate for business. On top of already discounted room rates, Playa del Sol Los Cabos, near downtown San Jose del Cabo, is throwing in free breakfast for two and a $100 food and beverage credit to guests who book a four-night stay by the end of May.

To drive bookings across its Fiesta and Aqua brands in Mexico, Grupo Posadas is offering 35 percent off and daily breakfast buffet for two, with discounted rates from $146 a night through Sept. 8 at Fiesta Americana Grand Los Cabos.

Apartment rentals are also going for less. At Vacationroost.com, Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach, on the western side of the tip of Baja, has slashed rates to about $200 a night, about $100 off. While the low season often brings deals, these price cuts are “drastic and available through the end of the year,” said Julian Castelli, the site’s chief executive.

MEXICO CITY

Mexico’s capital, where a large number of H1N1 cases have been concentrated, has taken one of the hardest tourism hits. Grupo Habita, which manages eight stylish hotels in Mexico, including Habita, Condesa DF and Distrito Capital in Mexico City, lost an estimated $100,000 in food and beverage sales because of the mandatory closing of restaurants and bars for nearly two weeks. The group is offering a discount of 1,000 pesos a night to Mexican citizens, and while it had not formalized a promotion for non-Mexicans at press time, Rafael Micha, managing partner, said, “If they book a room, they are going to get the best deal ever.” Travelers will be upgraded on arrival when higher-level rooms are available, he said, and the group has been offering discounts of 33 percent or more to guests who inquire via e-mail through rsvp@hotelhabita.com.

Package deals offer some of the most dramatic discounts. A recent search on Expedia.com for Mexico City vacations turned up six-night deals in July for less than $900 for two people, including round-trip flights from Newark and lodging at the Casa Inn in the financial district.

PUERTO VALLARTA AREA

As part of an aggressive deals campaign across AM Resorts hotel brands, Dreams Puerto Vallarta is offering 35 percent discounts, $200 in resort credit and “two kids free” to travelers who book by June 15 for travel through Dec. 24.

The up-and-coming Riviera Nayarit region, along Mexico’s Pacific coast north of Puerto Vallarta, has been stressing that no reported cases of the H1N1 virus have emerged there. Yet the region has also been suffering from the swine flu fallout. To help spur business, Marival Resorts and Suites has slashed summer all-inclusive rates by 25 percent to $66 a person a night. Nearby, the new Ayia Punta Mita condominium resort, in the private development that also houses a Four Seasons, St. Regis and two Jack Nicklaus golf courses, is offering two-bedroom condos from $250 a night, down from $350. The St. Regis, which was promoting a fourth night free, is now offering a third night free to travelers who book by June 30.
