Destination clubs came into their own five years ago, as a growing number of affluent travelers sought all the advantages of a fancy second home without the inconvenience of upkeep or the monotony of going back to the same place year after year.

Lusso, another destination club, filed for bankruptcy.

For a one-time deposit of $40,000 to more than $1.5 million — depending on how luxurious the accommodations and how long the stay — and annual dues of $3,000 to $100,000, club members would have access to an array of multimillion-dollar properties in prime resort locations —a stone farmhouse in Tuscany, an oceanfront villa in Costa Rica, a slopeside chalet in Aspen, Colo. Before they arrived, the club’s concierge would have stocked the refrigerator with the family’s favorite foods, arranged airport transfers, booked tee times or made restaurant reservations.

And for a while, the clubs thrived. Many used the hefty deposits and readily available credit to start building their collection of properties. Then, taking advantage of rapidly rising real estate prices, particularly in luxury markets, the clubs used their newly grown equity to take on more debt and acquire more homes. That, in turn, allowed them to lure more members with an increasing portfolio of destinations.

About 17 clubs opened in 2004 and 2005, alone. By 2007, revenue reached $610 million and membership to 5,900, according to data from Ragatz Associates, a resort consulting firm and SherpaReport.com, which tracks the industry.

But when the economy fell apart, it largely took the destination clubs’ business model with it. Home values have dropped, new credit has dried up and membership sales have plummeted, leaving many of the clubs with more bills than income. Several have filed for bankruptcy. Some have asked members for special extra payments to help them survive. And others have made significant cuts in business expenses.

“It really was the confluence of the perfect storm,” said Richard Keith, chairman of Ultimate Escapes.

The second-largest destination club with 1,200 members, Ultimate Escapes was created by a merger of Ultimate Resort and Private Escapes in 2008. But the merger left the club overloaded with real estate just as the market was taking a turn for the worse. That and a substantial downturn in membership sales led the club to seek a $22 million assessment from members, equal to about a year’s dues each, to keep the business going. Early this month, the club said it had received enough payments to continue.

Quintess, the Leading Residences of the World, the third-largest destination club based on members, made a similar move late last year, reducing operating expenses and asking members to pay higher annual dues.

In late January, High Country Club, which was founded in 2005 and quickly grew to about 375 members, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, listing hundreds of creditors and debt totaling about $25 million.

Smaller clubs, like the 140-member Portofino and the 150-member Lusso, with residences that averaged more than $3.5 million, also filed for bankruptcy last year. And the exclusive Yellowstone Club World, a collection of properties from Tim Blixseth, the developer of the elite Rocky Mountain ski and golf resort called the Yellowstone Club, never got off the ground.

“It’s a very emotional situation to say the least,” said Nick Copley, president of the SherpaReport.com. “People have not only lost their money but also lost their vacation.”

Kasey D’Amato, a dermatology physician assistant from Los Angeles, who joined High Country Club last July, paid a $40,000 deposit and about $4,600 in annual dues in exchange for 19 nights of travel a year. She and her husband, Stephen, had two vacations planned — Easter weekend in Aspen and a May trip to the Turks and Caicos — when the club went under.

“They just canceled the reservations,” Ms. D’Amato said. Beyond the lost vacations, she added, “No one likes to lose that kind of money.”

Unlike time shares, which operate under specific laws, destination clubs are largely self-regulated, although standard contract laws and other consumer protection do apply. Like country club members, destination club members do not own the properties. Rather they pay annual dues for upkeep and access to the homes for a set number of days each year.

This is not the first time the destination club industry has contracted or its viability has been called into question, though this is the most serious situation. In 2006, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Tanner & Haley, then one of the industry’s major players, left more than 800 members as unsecured creditors. Clubs scrambled to demonstrate their soundness and to reassure investors. A few merged to cut expenses and increase membership. 

“We’ve kind of been through this before,” said Jeff Potter, chief executive of Exclusive Resorts, the largest club, with more than 3,400 members. Stephen M. Case, the co-founder of AOL and head of the investment company Revolution, is the majority owner. To deal with the challenging times, Mr. Potter said, the club has reduced marketing expenses and corporate overhead. But over the seven years the club has been in operation, he said, its model has been tweaked to prepare for “all kinds of circumstances.”

In Maui, High Country Club has vacation houses and a private golf course. The club filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January.

The current shakeout, club officials say, is simply the industry righting itself in a tough economy, rather than a flawed business model. “Anytime there’s a boom, there are a bunch of people that shouldn’t be involved or maybe who are not as responsible that get into it,” said Ben Addoms, executive vice president of sales and marketing for Quintess.

Quintess has cut operating expenses by about 30 percent, increased dues and has said it plans to reduce the size of its housing portfolio to about 70 homes, from 80.

So-called equity destination clubs, like Equity Estates and Abercrombie & Kent Residence Club, see the industry turmoil as an opportunity. Unlike their counterparts whose members have no ownership stake, equity destination clubs are set up so that members have a stake in the company that owns the homes.

“Members own the club,” said Jarvis J. Slade Jr., president of the Abercrombie & Kent Residence Club. “The club owns the homes with no debt.” With all the problems nonequity clubs are facing, he said, “The model we chose is resonating more than ever.”

Despite the problems, some members are still fans of the destination club concept.

Having stayed with his wife and two children at upscale properties on South Carolina's elite Kiawah Island; in Stowe, Vt.; and in Manhattan — never having to worry about going grocery shopping when they arrived or finding tickets to a show — Jack I. London said he committed to the Ultimate Escapes assessment early. Even if the company were to wind down, said Mr. London, who owns a financial services business in Dover, Mass., “I still like the concept, and I still would like to remain in a destination club.”

Even members who lost money in clubs that have filed under bankruptcy laws continue to be bullish on the concept. Ms. D’Amato, the High Country Club member, is already comparison shopping for a new club, swapping stories with members at DestinationClubForums.com.

“It’s a new industry,” she said. “It’s still a work in progress. It’s a bummer, but we’re still open-minded.”
