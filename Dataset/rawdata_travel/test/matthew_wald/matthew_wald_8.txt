 THE “cash for clunkers” program will be back in full swing this weekend after President Obama signed a program extension on Friday. The $2 billion infusion should help dealers sell thousands of cars to customers who can reap a bounty of $3,500 to $4,500 for trading in an old vehicle.

The short-term effect will be obvious, but the program’s longer-term value — either as a method of stimulating the economy or saving energy — is less clear. Economists say that most buyers simply moved up the timing of their purchase, and that the projected gasoline savings are exaggerated because many of the trade-ins were seldom used.

The program’s first $1 billion was considered money well spent, at least by the new car industry, because it lured a quarter-million buyers into dealerships; the vehicles they purchased would go about 60 percent farther on a gallon of gasoline than the ones they turned in.

But measuring the stimulative effect of the program would require employing scientific methods like those used in drug trials, where some participants are given a placebo instead of the drug being tested. The problem, according to market experts, is that nearly everyone who bought new cars would have done so at some point anyway.

So what will sales be like in the coming months, now that many consumers have moved up their plans to buy a new vehicle? There were extra sales in July and the same will be true in August. And the number of sales under the program will be measured precisely — the Transportation Department said 245,384 vehicles had been sold by Friday morning, with rebates totaling $1.03 billion.

But the Transportation Department will not be able to measure how many shoppers would have purchased a car this fall — when the 2010 models go on sale — or in the winter or spring.

Likewise the fuel savings will be hard to calculate. Here is a possible best case: The average clunker traveled 12,000 miles a year at 16 miles a gallon, consuming 750 gallons. It was replaced with a new vehicle — probably a car, although the “clunkers” offered by the public were often pickups or S.U.V.’s — that can travel the same 12,000 miles on 480 gallons, a savings of 270 gallons.

Multiply by 245,000, the number of vehicles purchased using the first $1 billion of incentives, and the country burns 66.2 million fewer gallons of gasoline a year, or about 1.6 million barrels. At the rate America burns oil, that is about a two-hour supply.

Here is a possible worst case: The clunker was a pickup or S.U.V. driven only a few thousand miles a year because the family had other vehicles. When the cost of fuel went up, the gas-guzzling clunker was relegated to the back of the driveway.

Now the family has traded the clunker for a new fuel-efficient sedan, which will be driven 12,000 miles a year. The miles it displaces are not the ones that would have been traveled in the old S.U.V., but by another sedan that is still on the road. That, in turn, reduces the mileage improvement and gasoline savings achieved.

In multicar households — which is to say, in most American households — the newest car often gets driven the most miles, and the oldest one the least. So, some researchers rightly ask, how fuel-efficient is the car the family still owns but which will now be parked more often?

“There’s no real way to calculate it without making a bunch of assumptions,” said Lee Schipper, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and at Stanford.

Others acknowledge the problem. “The cash for clunkers program helps the economy a lot and improves oil security a little,” said Jason S. Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and an old hand at energy and pollution policy. He formerly headed a multistate clean air agency, and served on President Obama’s transition team.

“The fuel-saving benefits pale in comparison to President Obama’s significant strengthening of mileage standards earlier this year,” Mr. Grumet said, “but every little bit helps.”

He was referring to the national fuel economy standard signed into law in May that will be phased in beginning with the 2012 model year. By 2016, cars will have to average 39 miles a gallon.

That raises more questions. Seven years from now, when cars have to average 39 miles a gallon, what will we think of a government program that enticed hundreds of thousands of consumers to buy vehicles that got 30 miles a gallon (and that in 2016 will be middle-aged)? Had the program not existed, some of those buyers might have waited until 2012, when the new mileage rules begin to be phased in.

But in the end, “cash for clunkers” may help undo a previous government program: for years, small businesses got a tax break for buying S.U.V.’s, but only if they were the very largest — at least 6,000 pounds.
