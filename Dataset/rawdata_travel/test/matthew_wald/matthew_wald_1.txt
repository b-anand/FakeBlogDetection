AFTER years of widespread concern over how to refine enough gasoline, how to deliver enough megawatts of electricity and how to keep from drowning in carbon dioxide, the United States suddenly has fuel and energy in surplus, and the country is looking greener.

Can it last? And would that be a good thing?

The recession was hardly anybody’s idea of a good way to put the country on a sensible energy diet. But it may have done just that. Many coal plants whose emissions were spreading acid rain, mercury and the ingredients of global warming have not been running as much lately, and the price of coal was down by half in the last year — like the price of oil. Demand for electricity was down 1 percent last year and another 4 percent in the first half of 2009; ordinarily, electric use would be expected to grow 5 percent in three to four years. Industrial demand was down to levels not seen since the 1990s.

“We’re probably down 7 to 8 percent this year,” said Anthony F. Earley, chief executive of DTE, the parent of Detroit Edison. “Traditionally, we would expect to recover that in a year or two, but I don’t think anyone here believes this is going to be a traditional recovery.” Other electric systems as diverse as the Tennessee Valley Authority and Florida Power and Light have also seen demand drop. Many utilities, said Amory B. Lovins, an expert on energy efficiency, are “unexpectedly finding patterns of declining demand in previously robust sectors that they think may represent a basic change in previous trends.”

This might be an “inflection point” in the American economy, said Mark Cooper, a research fellow and energy expert at the Vermont Law School, when new houses stop getting bigger (or getting built), and appliances and other devices using electricity do more work with less power.

Improvements in efficiency are likely to continue. Congress has mandated lots of them, including that the general purpose incandescent lightbulb be phased out, beginning in 2012.

In fact, if this recession is an inflection point, it is not the first. Jay Apt, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and executive director of its Electricity Industry Center, said that growth in use of electricity had been exponential from the 1950s until about 1973, and linear since then. Part of the reason was that by 1973, “We’d just about finished air-conditioning the country,” he said.

And part was a de-industrializing economy. Industrial use of electricity in 2008 was about the same as in 1994, he said. That is partly because industries are more efficient, and partly because industrial growth has moved abroad, where electricity is cheaper.

“There is really profound uncertainty” about the future level of demand for electricity. On one hand is industrial stagnation, growing efficiency and price increases brought on by carbon controls and population growth, and on the other, proliferation of new devices that use electricity, including plug-in cars, Professor Apt said.

A carbon cost, if Congress agrees on a climate bill, could further retard demand. For example, if consumers had to pay $30 for each ton of carbon emitted by the electric system, rates would increase by 15 to 20 percent. That might stunt growth, as rate increases did in the 1970s when there were higher oil and natural gas prices and expensive nuclear plants were being completed.

In the transportation fuel market, demand for gasoline in the United States has probably peaked, because miles traveled are down. Explanations vary. One is that the population is aging and older people drive less. Lester R. Brown, a natural resources expert, said another is that young people who once went cruising in their cars now socialize with Facebook and Twitter. Stricter fuel-economy standards are also about to kick in. Their effect depends on how quickly the current car fleet is replaced, but with a new fuel-economy average of 35.5 miles a gallon — a 40 percent increase to be phased in by 2016 — gasoline demand and prices seem poised to decline. Corn ethanol is already cutting demand for crude oil and for products from refineries. If the government mandate for ethanol from nonfood sources like wood or plant wastes is realized, gasoline demand could drop further.

And if there is slow growth or no growth in liquid fuels or electricity, any greener substitutes — electricity from wind, ethanol from wood chips — could displace a dirtier incumbent fuel.

STILL, the consensus in the power industry is that demand will come back, but slowly. David K. Owens, vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association of the investor-owned utilities, said the average residential customer had 26 devices in the home running on electricity. Yes, many devices will do more with less power in the future, he said, so “you are a more efficient user of electricity, but you just have more stuff.”

The growth in use of electronic devices — cellphones, televisions, computers and other devices that use electricity to handle information — is huge, 9 to 12 percent of energy consumption, by some estimates, in a category that hardly existed 20 years ago. Then, add in the plug-in car, either hybrid or pure electric. A residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt-hours a month of electricity might use another 100 for a plug-in car, said Mr. Owens. (Depending on the car, that would be enough to travel 300 or 400 miles.) That would create demand for energy, but probably not for new generating stations, because the cars could be charged at night when other demand was light.

In April, Jon Wellinghoff, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said that because of the combination of renewable energy and energy conservation, the United States might not need to build any coal or nuclear plants to meet the base-load capacity that runs around the clock and is supplemented by natural gas and other sources at peak periods.

“We may not need any, ever,” he said.

But flat demand would not mean the end of power plant construction, because old plants wear out. “By 2050, 70 percent of existing capacity will be gone,” said William D. Johnson, president and chief executive of Progress Energy. Nearly all the nuclear reactors will be at least 50 years old by then, Mr. Johnson said, and renewables, efficiency or policies that discourage use will not replace all the retiring plants.

“We need to think about how we’re going to replace that,” he said. “We’re going to be building a lot of something.”
