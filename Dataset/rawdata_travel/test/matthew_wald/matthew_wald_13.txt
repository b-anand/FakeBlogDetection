Confronting a string of six fatal commuter plane crashes, top federal officials promised on Monday to set new rules to limit fatigue, make the carriers more thoroughly investigate the histories of pilots they want to hire, and push small airlines into adopting the safety programs that are common among big carriers, by threatening to expose the laggards.

The new chief of the Federal Aviation Administration, J. Randolph Babbitt, said the major carriers — the ones whose colors the small airlines use — should involve themselves more thoroughly in pilot training at the regional carriers, with senior pilots “mentoring” the entry-level pilots at the regional lines.

Mr. Babbitt and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, along with dozens of airline executives, union officials, F.A.A. inspectors and other safety experts, gathered at a closed-door meeting on regional carrier safety, prompted by the crash on Feb. 12 of a twin-engine turboprop on a flight from Newark to Buffalo. The plane was operated by Colgan Air, doing business as Continental Connection under a contract with Continental Airlines.

Including that crash, which killed 50, there have been six fatal passenger airline crashes, all involving regional carriers, since the last fatal crash of a major United States carrier’s plane, an American Airlines flight in New York in November 2001.

After the meeting, Mr. LaHood said it was important to ensure that the small airlines’ safety was as good as the big ones’.

“For common ordinary citizens, when they get on a United Express flight, they think they’re on United Airlines,” he said.

The first officer in the Colgan Air turboprop, earning about $24,000 a year and living with her parents on the West Coast, had stayed up all night to fly in to begin her work shift at Newark the day of the fatal flight, and the captain had also showed signs of fatigue, based on data from the cockpit voice recorder.

Mr. Babbitt said union officials at the meeting had shown a willingness to foster “professionalism in the cockpit” regarding fitness for duty. Mr. Babbitt said the pilots’ starting salary at the regional airlines was a problem.

“If you expect to get the best and the brightest, I don’t think you’re going to get that for very long at $24,000,” he said, although he added that when he began his career as an airline pilot in 1966, he earned about that much, after adjusting for inflation.

But Mr. Babbitt also said F.A.A. rules on the maximum number of hours a pilot could fly or be on duty and the minimum number of hours’ rest required between shifts did not take into account the strain of flying six or eight 50-minute flights a day, with multiple takeoffs and landings, versus a single long-distance flight.

For years, the aviation agency has tried to modernize the rules on flight and duty hours, but has been unable to win consensus in the industry; airlines do not want to add costs by hiring more pilots, and many pilots like to get in a month’s worth of flying in as few days as possible.

But Mr. Babbitt promised, “We are going to get a new rule.” The federal agency writes rules mostly by winning agreement among industry participants, but Mr. Babbitt said that “at the end of the day, if there’s two or three open issues, they will be decided and there will be a rule.”

Big airlines commonly have safety programs that allow anonymous reporting of problems, to remove the fear of repercussion for pilots. The big carriers also analyze information pulled from on-board equipment that resembles the flight data recorder, to look for safety gaps. Mr. LaHood said the F.A.A. would encourage small airlines, which generally do not have such programs, to adopt them, and publicize the names of those that do not.

Both men also called for changes in the law that gives airlines the right to get pilots’ detailed work histories from previous employers. That law was passed after a 1995 crash of an American Eagle flight; the pilot had joined the airline four days after being forced to quit by another airline for incompetence.

Experts now say that the new rule, which requires previous employers to give up information on a job candidate’s tenure, does not go far enough. The captain in the crash outside Buffalo had failed three in-cockpit exams, called “check rides,” before he came to Colgan, but Colgan knew about only one. Mr. Babbitt said the F.A.A. would now make it clear that airlines are expected to require job applicants to waive their right to privacy, and then ask the F.A.A. for such data.
