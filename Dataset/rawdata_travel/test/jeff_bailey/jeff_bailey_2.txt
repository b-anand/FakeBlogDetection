Southwest Airlines, initially combative in the face of a $10.2 million fine from the Federal Aviation Administration for inspection lapses, took a more conciliatory tone on Tuesday. The company said that it had suspended three employees, hired an outside maintenance expert and was “fully engaged” with F.A.A. officials auditing the carrier.

Both the agency and the airline were embarrassed by a disclosure that two F.A.A. inspectors had complained that an agency supervisor allowed Southwest to operate older Boeing 737s that had gone past a deadline for inspection.

The charges of the inspectors were investigated by the federal Office of Special Counsel and by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The inquiry resulted in last week’s fine.

The agency said Southwest had flown 46 planes from June 18, 2006, to March 14, 2007 — on 59,791 flights — without complying with an order to inspect them for cracks. The inspection order covered older planes.

Rather than grounding the planes immediately when it discovered its lapse, Southwest kept operating them from March 15 to March 23, 2007, on 1,451 more flights. The size of the fine, a record, was because of what the F.A.A. called these “deliberate violations.”

All the planes have been inspected; cracks were found and fixed on six planes.

Linda B. Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman, said Tuesday of the flights from March 15 to 23: “We did believe that the F.A.A. approved of those actions.” The approval came locally, she added.

“By federal law these aircraft should have been grounded until they were in compliance, but they continued to fly, with full knowledge of the F.A.A. supervisor,” James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the House transportation panel, said last week. He said the delay had occurred “so that Southwest could conveniently schedule them for inspection without disrupting their commercial schedule.”

In its first public reaction to the F.A.A. fine, Southwest said, in part, “The F.A.A. approved our actions and considered the matter closed as of April 2007.” The company called the required inspection “one of many routine and redundant inspections.”

It also produced a statement from Boeing, the manufacturer, vouching for the planes’ safety.

But Tuesday, Gary C. Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive, said the company had conducted its own inquiry. “I am concerned with some of our findings,” he said in a prepared statement.

As a result, he said that three employees had been placed on administrative leave. Southwest would not name the workers or their positions, but said the three were cooperating with the airline’s investigation.

Mr. Kelly also said the carrier had “hired a respected outside consultant with proven experience to help review its maintenance program controls.” He said Southwest had told F.A.A. officials “that it will investigate and address any deficiencies.”

Mr. Oberstar plans a hearing on the whistle-blowers’ complaints on April 3. He has asked the F.A.A. to “clean house, from the top down,” to deal with what he called a “carrier-favorable, cozy relationship” between the agency and the airlines.
