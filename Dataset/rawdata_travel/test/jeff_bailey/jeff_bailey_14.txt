Southwest Airlines abandoned its longstanding first-come-first-served approach to seating yesterday, giving business travelers, who pay the highest fares, first choice in boarding.

Those travelers will also receive extra frequent-flier credits and a free alcoholic beverage, in a move the airline expects to bring in an additional $100 million a year.

Southwest, which for 36 years has competed with low fares and a simple business approach, is becoming a more complex company. The number of fares it might offer on a single flight, for instance, is increasing to as many as 15, from the current 8.

The changes are prompted by increased competition from traditional carriers like United Airlines and American Airlines, which have reduced their costs in recent years and can now profitably offer many fares equivalent to Southwest’s.

Rising fuel prices, meanwhile, have forced the airlines to increase fares. For Southwest, attracting more business travelers is crucial in seeking more revenue per ticket.

While Southwest will be competing more aggressively for business travelers, its changes could actually help other airlines by generally lifting fares.

The changes are intended “to create a reason for people to give us more money,” the chief executive, Gary C. Kelly, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve not done that in the past very well.”

Starting today, a new class of Southwest fares, called “business select,” will cost $10 to $30 more than the airline’s recent highest fares, which were typically purchased at the last minute.

Passengers paying the extra money will receive “A” boarding passes, allowing them to line up in the first group; in the past, all passengers, regardless of how much they paid, had a more or less equal opportunity to get an “A” pass by checking in online, beginning 24 hours before a flight. Preboarding for families and others who need more time, which used to occur before “A” group boarding, was recently switched to after “A” boarding.

The change brings Southwest more into line with conventional airlines, which have long showered perks on their highest-paying passengers.

Anyone who makes 16 round trips on Southwest in 12 months will automatically receive “A” boarding passes.

Southwest also changed its Web site, which will now show only three fares a flight: “business select”; a separate refundable fare known as “business” that comes without the perks; and “wanna get away,” the cheapest fare available, which is not refundable.

For people who think of Southwest as primarily a leisure-class airline, Mr. Kelly said, “We violently disagree.” It has the frequency of flights between many major markets that are expected of a business-class airline, he said, though in the past perhaps it “hasn’t really told that story.”
