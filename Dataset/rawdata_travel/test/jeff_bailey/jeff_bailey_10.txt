 The parent company of American Airlines, AMR, said yesterday that it planned to shed its American Eagle regional airline unit, after an investor group called on the company to bolster its stock price by getting rid of some operations.

Shares of AMR rose 7 percent, or $1.42, yesterday on the news, to $21.98. That is about 46 percent below the stock’s 12-month high of $41, as higher fuel prices threaten to bring an abrupt halt to the airline industry’s recovery.

AMR is also studying whether to shed other operations, including its big frequent-flier program, a money-management operation and even some maintenance operations, Thomas W. Horton, chief financial officer, said in an interview. He said no decision on those had been made.

Other carriers, including United Airlines, are considering divestitures as well.

Airlines, which have passed along regular fare increases in the last two years, have found it hard in recent months to collect more per ticket. Rising fuel prices are threatening renewed losses, and the industry faces labor negotiations that could raise costs significantly.

American Eagle employs more than 13,000 workers, operates about 300 planes and makes about 1,700 flights a day. AMR said the regional operation expected 2007 revenue of about $2.3 billion; AMR’s total for 2006 was $22.6 billion.

Mr. Horton would not say if American Eagle was profitable.

The unit flies mostly smaller jets that feed passengers from smaller cities to American hubs in Dallas, Chicago, Miami and elsewhere.

Other big carriers shed their regional airline operations years ago and now hire operators of smaller jets to fly under the big carrier’s name. After Sept. 11, 2001, as passenger demand plunged, big carriers shrank their fleets, increasingly turning to regional airlines to serve smaller markets and even some major markets, with 50- and 70-passenger jets. Growth has since slowed among regional carriers.

AMR said the divestiture could come as a spinoff to its shareholders or as an outright sale of American Eagle. In addition to other regional airlines that might want to expand through a purchase, private equity firms might be attracted to the business, said Roger King, an analyst at CreditSights.

That is because regional airlines typically have long-term contracts to supply service to bigger carriers, which could be a steady source of revenue to service debt taken on to finance a purchase.

American has an agreement for American Eagle to continue flying the routes it serves now. At some point in the future, however, Mr. Horton said, American could divide its regional flying contracts among several airlines and use competition to drive down the price it pays.

In September, the FL Group, an investment firm based in Iceland that holds about a 9 percent stake in AMR, asked American to consider moves to bolster its share price, including spinning off its frequent-flier plan.

Pardus Capital Management, which holds large stakes in Delta Air Lines and United, has recommended those two carriers merge to reduce costs and improve profits.
