 Southwest Airlines, with a raucous corporate culture that is the exception in the grim airline industry, stands to look even wilder as some of its big competitors contemplate mergers that would only further muddy their corporate identities.

Gary C. Kelly, the chief executive at Southwest, must compete in an industry with thinning profits. But he wants to preserve a corporate culture that includes diversions like Halloween skits.

For proof that Southwest is sticking with its oddball ways, look no further than its chief executive, Gary C. Kelly, who transformed himself from a buttoned-down C.P.A. to one of Corporate America’s most colorful bosses.

His first week at Southwest, in 1986, Mr. Kelly sat in his car in the headquarters parking lot one morning, wearing Hawaiian shorts and a polo shirt as he had been instructed. He was a worried man. “I thought everybody was playing a joke on me,” he said. “I had my normal suit in the car — just in case.” (No joke — just Hawaiian shorts day.)

In the 22 years since, Mr. Kelly, 52, has risen from financial controller to chief executive and has loosened up about what he wears to work. His administrative assistant, Gillian Kelley, has seen it. She pitched in last year when he was too busy to shop for the size 14 women’s high heels he had been wanting.

“Some pretty embarrassing Web sites we had to sort through,” Ms. Kelley said. She pulled the whole outfit together. And she added, grimacing, “The most awkward thing — fitting your boss with prosthetic breasts.”

It had to be kept hush-hush, so that the 6-foot-3 Mr. Kelly could surprise the 2,400 workers at headquarters with his most outlandish Halloween outfit ever: Edna Turnblad, the bouffant mom from the musical “Hairspray.”

Even in drag, oddly, Mr. Kelly was conforming — to a culture that has helped make Southwest the only consistently profitable company in the domestic airline industry. The episode last October revealed him as an unusual corporate chief these days, one trying to fit the mold of his company rather than trying to mold the company in his own image.

Indeed, as chief executives, owners and strategies shift rapidly at American companies, distinct corporate cultures — the sense of history, the best and worst impulses of an organization — are often swept aside.

The resulting homogenization of workplaces is because of “the C.E.O. cult,” said Edward Lawler, who directs the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. Many new chief executives do not think twice before dispensing with company customs. They say, in effect, “I know what’s right. I can see the world more clearly,” Mr. Lawler said.

A few throwbacks remain. U.P.S., the big shipper, still promotes truck drivers and parcel sorters to the executive ranks. Some technology companies, young and profitable enough to indulge creative workers, remain offbeat playgrounds.

But few big employers are as quirky as Southwest. Its founder and chairman, Herbert D. Kelleher, developed a mighty chip on his shoulder in the 1970s, as other airlines tried to drive the upstart Southwest out of business. Mr. Kelleher, now 76, channeled that, creating an us-against-them attitude that somehow made it seem fun to work harder than other airlines.

And to top it off he reveled publicly in his own love of drink and cigarettes, helping give Southwest a party image.

“It was a shock,” Mr. Kelly said of his arrival. But over time, Mr. Kelly strained, as it were, to fit the mold.

And what a mold: a startling amount of office hugging and kissing in lieu of handshakes; elaborate practical jokes; and on-the-premises beer drinking at headquarters, as long as it is after 5 p.m.

These, of course, amount to only small dials on the corporate control panel, intended to lighten the mood and put a little bounce in the step of the nearly 35,000 Southwest employees.

Mr. Kelly is also pulling on the big levers, fundamentally changing the airline’s business: raising fares, packing more people onto planes, and abandoning an egalitarian boarding policy for one that lets business travelers board and pick seats first. He needs to lift revenue by $1.5 billion a year to offset rising fuel expenses.

But making those big changes stick requires the enthusiastic support of Southwest workers.

Ray James, a Southwest gate agent at Love Field here, for instance, was unaccustomed to policing passengers under the Southwest’s old cattle-call boarding process. But now, he has to try to get people to line up, A-1, A-2, and so on. It is a lot more work. “I don’t want to see you at the front,” he said he scolds people who hold an A-31 boarding pass.

The small stuff, then — making the airline a nice, maybe even fun place to work — matters, too. If you have not flown Southwest, you might not know that the service, while no-frills, is generally cheerful.

And on many days that is enough to distinguish it from other airlines, where the workers have a hard time masking bitterness over pay cuts, increased workloads and often contentious relations with management.

How does wearing a pink dress fit into all this?

It suggests to workers that Mr. Kelly is a little crazy, not just another suit, and perhaps the kind of person others might want to follow into battle.

So, yes, Mr. Kelly’s financial acumen is all well and good. A fuel-cost hedging plan he devised in 1999 has saved Southwest $3 billion. And at current oil prices, it will save an additional $2.4 billion over the next few years. That essentially is what kept the company out of deep trouble in recent years.

But workers accustomed to the crowd-pleasing personality of Mr. Kelleher, who retires as chairman in May, want to know that Mr. Kelly is a regular guy, too.

“I’m not sure. I think he’s committed to hanging onto that culture,” said Charles Cerf, president of Transport Workers Union Local 555, which represents about 6,800 Southwest ground workers. But, he added, “I’m a little apprehensive.”

“It’s important they know who you are, especially in a company where we have a legendary founder and chairman,” Mr. Kelly said.

He has accepted Mr. Kelleher’s greater star power, and it gives him opportunity for self-mockery. Sure, Mr. Kelly has met Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways, he said, but quickly added, “I was holding Herb’s drink.”

Many new corporate chiefs insist that the former boss depart the premises. But Mr. Kelly and Mr. Kelleher seem comfortable with the ambiguity of a years-long shift in power.

“If you screw up, he’s quick to tell you,” Mr. Kelly said. “I’ve had my fair share of being taken to the woodshed.” Even while chief executive, he added.

Mr. Kelly will probably never seem as outrageous as Mr. Kelleher, but next to his peers at other airlines he seems wild. “Let me just say,” Mr. Kelly said, “at 52, I’d never dressed as a woman.” He is already pondering next year’s costume.

Southwest’s headquarters building here, alongside a runway at Love Field, looks from the exterior like a giant concrete bunker, with few windows. Top executives sit in smallish interior offices, away from natural light, spaces a little nicer than a janitor’s closet.

The place manages to be quite festive, however, in the style of a college dormitory hallway, because virtually every inch of wall space is covered with framed photographs of workers, plaques and oddball advertisements. Cheap but fun is the message.

The Halloween celebration evolved over the years from a few folks in costume to a full day of well-rehearsed skits.

Does any work get done that day? “No. None,” said Laura Wright, chief financial officer.

The chili cook-off in April blows most of a day, too.

The premise behind all this is that a little fun translates into a lot of productivity. Southwest, after pay cuts at other airlines, has the industry’s highest wages. But because of efficient work habits, measured in how much it spends to fly a passenger a given distance, its costs are the lowest among big airlines.

“You have to work fast,” said Mr. Cerf, the union officer. Workers who come to Southwest after being laid off by other airlines often quit, he said. “They’re not to used to working that hard.”

Affection is big, too, and worries about sexual harassment that killed off physical contact at many companies are kept in check here. Ms. Wright, the finance chief, estimates she has been kissed by Mr. Kelleher, during her 20 years at Southwest, about 500 times.

“That’s probably low,” she corrected herself. “It’s every time you see Herb.”

Michael G. Van de Ven, another former accountant and now an executive vice president, said his job interview with Mr. Kelleher in 1993 made an impression: “I stuck out my hand and he hugged me and he kissed me.”

Practical jokes are an approved activity, too, and Mr. Kelly makes a tempting target. Before Mr. Kelly was named chief executive in 2004, Tammy Romo, Southwest’s controller, created a fictitious secret admirer for him and started sending him mash notes and love poems.

Married to his eighth-grade sweetheart and not quite as kissy as Mr. Kelleher, Mr. Kelly worried he might have an embarrassing personnel problem on his hands. “Man, I was nervous as a cat,” he said. Added his assistant, Ms. Kelley, “She had him hook, line and sinker.”

After a week, Ms. Romo relented and let Mr. Kelly know it was all a gag. “You’re so gullible,” she told him. Mr. Kelly returned the favor by contributing heavily to a fund-raising contest in her name, meaning she was among the Southwest executives dropped, in front of workers, into a dunking tank.
