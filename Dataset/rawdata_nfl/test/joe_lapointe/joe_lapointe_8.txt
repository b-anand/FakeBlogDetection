 Giants defensive end Justin Tuck was blunt Monday when he expanded on comments made Sunday by middle linebacker Antonio Pierce about how the defense had a communication problem during a 40-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Pierce refused to elaborate, but Tuck said he knew it was true ''when a guy scores a touchdown and guys are looking at each other like 'I thought this' and 'I thought that.' ''

This seemed to suggest, in part, the positioning of the defensive backs, who did not always seem sure of whom to cover as Donovan McNabb threw three touchdown passes. Tuck's words also hinted that players were not always quick to follow the instructions of Bill Sheridan, the defensive coordinator who sends in the plays, or the adjustments of Pierce, who can revise a play before the snap of the ball.

''We're out there thinking too much,'' Tuck said. ''We do so many checks.'' The checks are revisions made by Pierce off Sheridan's calls once Pierce sees offensive alignments.

Someone asked Tuck if it would help to simplify things. ''Who knows?'' Tuck replied. ''It doesn't matter what I think. I don't know. Maybe I'll have to think about it and see what happens.''

Coach Tom Coughlin last week groused that Eli Manning's offense took too much time with ''the chess game'' before the snap. He implied Monday the same about Pierce's defense. He also cited coaching responsibility. ''It is a matter of timing, of getting it communicated,'' Coughlin said. ''If you are not ready to go, even if you get the call, it doesn't make any difference.''

The return of Michael Boley and Chris Canty could help. Boley, a linebacker, has missed four games after having knee surgery. Canty, a defensive lineman, has missed seven games with a calf injury. Coughlin said Boley and Canty should practice Wednesday.

But Aaron Ross, a cornerback idle all season with a hamstring problem, is not ready. And safety Kenny Phillips is out for the season after having knee surgery; C. C. Brown has replaced him.

The Giants (5-3), losers of three straight games, have fallen into third in the National Football Conference East, a half-game behind Philadelphia and Dallas. The Giants' next eight opponents have a combined record of 36-21.

On Sunday, the Giants will host the San Diego Chargers, who are led by Philip Rivers. It will be the first time Manning and Rivers have faced each other in the N.F.L. Current passer ratings -- not always the most accurate measure -- show Rivers fourth in the N.F.L. at 95.9 and Manning 10th at 86.4. In passing yards per game, Rivers has 290.9 and Manning has 231.9. Rivers has thrown 4 interceptions and has been sacked 16 times compared to Manning's 8 in both categories.

''San Diego ain't going to come in here feeling sorry for us,'' Tuck said. ''The mentality right now is to right the ship. We are concerned. We still think we have a championship-caliber football team.''

Manning, who has thrown six of his eight interceptions during the slump, said he was not concerned. ''We just need to play better,'' he said. ''We are not in panic mode right now. Fans can get in panic mode and that is all right. We can't have the players get in panic mode.''
