 Donovan McNabb is a telephone communicator. For his next call, he could ring up Eli Manning to suggest how he might work out of his slump.

Or maybe not, at least not this week, as Manning’s Giants (5-2) take their two-game losing streak to Philadelphia on Sunday to play McNabb’s Eagles (4-2) with first place at stake in the National Football Conference East.

The Eagles are coming off a 27-17 victory at Washington on Monday night and have won three of their last four games. They also have defeated the Giants in their last two meetings.

During the division playoffs last last January at Giants Stadium, McNabb taunted the Giants. After running out of bounds on an 8-yard carry, he grabbed a telephone near the Giants’ bench and pretended to make a call. In a teleconference call on Wednesday with reporters, McNabb was asked whether he heard a dial tone on the Giants’ bench or maybe the voice of a surprised Giants coach.

“Verizon wasn’t working,” McNabb said with humor. “There was nothing over there.” McNabb’s action made for a widely distributed photograph.

Danny Clark, a Giants linebacker, said earlier this week that the Giants have kept that picture in their minds since then and are using it for motivation.

In view of that, McNabb was asked if he regretted what he did. “No,” he said. “I don’t have any regrets.” But what about psychologically motivating the Giants?

“In this game, do you really need any psychological motivation?” McNabb asked. “I don’t think so. This is a game you dream about playing.”

He added that using old slights for motivation would show a team was not “truly focused.” When asked whether the Giants reacted then, McNabb said: “I don’t remember. It was a while ago.”

McNabb also was asked about Rush Limbaugh, who once lost a commentary job at ESPN after saying that McNabb was overrated by journalists because they wanted a black quarterback to succeed.

Earlier this month, the N.F.L. ruled out Limbaugh’s bid to buy part of the St. Louis Rams. McNabb was asked his reaction. “No comment,” McNabb said.

No reaction?

“No,” he said.

Manning’s issues this week have been less edgy but just as serious. During Sunday’s 24-17 loss to Arizona, he threw three interceptions and took two delay-of-game penalties.

In the previous game at New Orleans, Manning spoke harshly to running back Ahmad Bradshaw after Bradshaw missed a blocking adjustment that resulted in blitz pressure and an interception.

“One mistake can turn into a game-changing play,” Manning said, adding that it can happen even if the other 10 players are doing the right thing.

But Coach Tom Coughlin suggested earlier this week that the tempo of the offense lags when the quarterback makes adjustments at the line of scrimmage and the play clock runs down.

Coughlin also said it was important for Manning to recognize circumstances and make good decisions on his throws. Manning, who said his foot injury was no longer a problem, seemed to agree.

“I’ve got to play better,” Manning said. “Football is not always going to be perfect every week. You are going to go through slumps.”

Cornerback Kevin Dockery missed practice for personal reasons that were “not injury related.” ... Ahmad Bradshaw traveled to Charlotte, N.C., to have his chronically sore right foot and ankle examined by a specialist, Dr. Robert Anderson. ... Antonio Pierce, the middle linebacker, missed practice with a sore ankle. Curiously, Pierce was not listed on the original injury report released before practice. ... Hakeem Nicks, the wide receiver who has caught touchdown passes in the last four games, was named the N.F.L.’s offensive rookie of the month.
