 Rex Ryan, the Jets’ first-year coach, is 46 years old. He came to work Wednesday with a gray stubble on his chin and cheeks. Mark Sanchez, the Jets’ rookie quarterback, turned 23 years old Wednesday. He came to work with much darker whiskers on his fresher-looking face.

“Don’t we wish we can all go back to being 23?” Ryan said. “Golly, he’s a young dude.”

As Ryan and Sanchez experience learning curves together, time marches on as the Jets begin the second half of their schedule at home Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Both teams are 4-4 and still in contention for the postseason. In that sense, Ryan acknowledged, it already felt a little like playoffs.

“It has to be,” Ryan said. “There’s no getting around this, you might as well admit it, it is that kind of game.” If the two teams tie in the standings, he said, head-to-head competition breaks it.

Some Jets have suggested they are better than their record. “Just like we feel we’re a good 4-4 team, they’ve got to be saying the same stuff,” Sanchez said, referring to the Jaguars.

Sanchez was asked about how he and Ryan are learning together. “He jokes about how he goes, I go,” Sanchez said, adding that his coach tells him “We’re in this together, rook.”

Sanchez has made his share of rookie mistakes, from throwing five interceptions during a defeat to the Bills to eating a hot dog on the bench during a victory at Oakland.

“After that Buffalo game, I learned a lot about body language and how that can spread,” Sanchez said. “People see that and notice.”

Opposing defensive coordinators also have had a chance to study on film the habits of a first-round draft choice who helped his team to a 3-0 start.

In that last week’s bye fell at exactly the midpoint of the schedule, Sanchez was much like a student on semester break. He went back to California to practice with his high school team. He spoke to some of his former teammates at Southern California about their season and marveled at how their schedule is near a conclusion and they soon will prepare for a bowl game.

Ryan, who prompted much laughter from his audience at his news conference, told of his friendship with Jack Del Rio, the Jaguars coach. They worked together in Baltimore.

“We’re very similar,” Ryan said. “Our teams are similar. We both like to run the football. Both teams are physical.”

Ryan then reached his punch line. “Jack was a great player, and he’s good looking,” Ryan added. “Apparently, maybe we’re not that similar.”

Ryan concluded: “This is going to be a fistfight. He knows it and I know it. We’re good buddies. We’re going to try to kill each other. That’s just the way it goes.”

Sanchez, while praising his coach for soliciting suggestions from players, also said that Ryan’s approach to coaching his players was “pretty much blunt-force trauma.”

“That’s his deal,” he said.

Another observer of Sanchez’s development is Damien Woody, the veteran tackle. Despite Sanchez’s body language against the Bills. “I didn’t get any sense he was throwing in the towel,” Woody said.

The timing of the bye week, Woody added, came at a perfect time for Sanchez.

“It gave him the opportunity to get his mind away from football and come back recharged at a critical time of the year, freshened up mentally and physically,” Woody said.

Braylon Edwards, the wide receiver, said, “There’s not too many losses we can have and still be on the cusp of getting into the playoffs.”

Edwards, a five-year-veteran at age 26, joked that he thought Sanchez turned 19 on Wednesday.

“It makes me feel like an old man,” Edwards said. “I’m talking to him and I’m sharing stories. I’ve got five years on this guy. It makes me feel weird.”


Rex Ryan discussed his decision to give his team a week off during the bye period. “We’ll be judged on if this was a good move or not based on the results Sunday,” he said. “Rightfully so. Our guys are going to come out firing, popping out of our skin.”... Linebacker Vernon Gholston did not practice Wednesday because of a hamstring injury.
