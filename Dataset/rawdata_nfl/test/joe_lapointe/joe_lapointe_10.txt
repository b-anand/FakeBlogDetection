Robert Nicks, the father of the Giants rookie Hakeem Nicks, was nicknamed Philly after moving to North Carolina from Philadelphia, where he grew up a fan of the Eagles and the Phillies.

The elder Nicks said by telephone from Charlotte on Friday that he hoped to recover from the flu to travel to Philadelphia to see his son’s Giants (5-2) play the Eagles (4-2) on Sunday.

“I’m still an Eagles fan,” said Philly Nicks, a former professional boxer. “But I’ve got to root for my son’s team.”

“I’m a little leery,” he added. “I’ve seen a whole lot of stuff in those stands. Those fans will just jump on you. I can’t beat all of them if 10 or 20 jump on me.”

The atmosphere is a little more peaceful at Lincoln Financial Field than it was at the old Veterans Stadium when Philly Nicks and his grandfather cheered for Randall Cunningham.

Hakeem Nicks lived his first 10 years in Philadelphia before reuniting with his father. He played football in high school in Charlotte, then at the University of North Carolina. Last week, he was named the N.F.L. rookie of the month after catching his fourth touchdown pass in four games.

“I wanted him to be a boxer, but he chose football,” Philly Nicks said.

Nicks, 21, could start Sunday because Mario Manningham has a shoulder injury. So far, Nicks has 16 receptions for 315 yards and leads the Giants with 19.7 yards per catch.

“I’m so proud of him,” Philly Nicks said. “I used to say to him, ‘Son, you’re going to be a superstar.’ He used to look up at me and say, ‘For real, Daddy?’ ”

Nicks and William Beatty, an offensive tackle, have been the most impressive Giants rookies so far. Nicks was drafted in the first round and Beatty in the second.

Beatty made his first start last week in place of Kareem McKenzie, the right tackle who had a groin-muscle injury. McKenzie practiced Friday and is likely to return.

But Nicks worked out with the first team Friday and said he would be ready if he was given his first N.F.L. start.

“I feel like I’m getting stable with the offense now,” he said.

Regarding his early success, Nicks said: “I’m very excited about it, but I just don’t want to let it get to my head. Just stay humble. It’s just my character and my mentality.”

Beatty, 24, also projects a humility that is not necessarily contagious among professional football players.

Off the field, he wears glasses, cooks, paints pictures and makes clothing.

Kevin Gilbride, the offensive coordinator of the Giants, said Beatty was “quiet and reflective,” and not as boisterous as some of his teammates.

“He is serious about doing well,” Gilbride said. “I am very proud that he rose up and responded positively to the opportunity to play.”

Beatty’s mother, Sylvia, is a pastor. Beatty has had a purpose for prayer since the recent stabbing death of Jasper Howard, a teammate at Connecticut, at a dance on campus after a game.

“I didn’t know him that well because he was younger than me,” Beatty said. “I was going out as he was going in. But we did go through a camp together, and in camp, you get close to people.”

Beatty said he could only imagine what it must be like to go to classes and practices and not see a teammate on what he called a close-knit campus.

“I don’t deal with that pain, but I do feel for the team, and my prayers go out to them and to the whole UConn community,” Beatty said. “When something happens to one, it happens to all.”

Beatty played the right side last week, but his natural position is on the left. Gilbride said that the learning curve was harder for a lineman like Beatty than for a receiver like Nicks.

“History has shown that very few receivers have come out and played well their rookie year,” Gilbride said.

“But I still think it is more difficult as a lineman because of the complexity.”

If a receiver runs the wrong route or misses a block, Gilbride said, it may not cost the team. “But if a lineman makes a mistake, it is probably a sack and maybe there is a turnover,” he said.

While Nicks joined a young group of receivers, Beatty is among veterans who have played together for several seasons. They help him on the field, Beatty said, and keep him humble off it.

“I take care of their needs and wants,” he said, adding that he must ask their permission to come and go from the meeting room.

“It’s all fun,” Beatty said. “Nothing too serious.”

Rich Seubert, the veteran guard, said rookies “just do what they’re told.”

He added: “We were all rookies before. Whatever we say, they do. And when they do it, they’re all right. So far, he’s been pretty good.”

Beatty said he had not yet cooked for them, although that could happen.

After Friday’s practice, Hicks chatted briefly in front of his locker with the veteran receiver Steve Smith. Then Hicks nodded, put on a red stocking cap, placed his playbook under his arm and left the room with a smile on his face and a bounce in his step.
