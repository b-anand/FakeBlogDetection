Ernie Bono said his friendship with Giants Coach Tom Coughlin was so close that “we always talk about doing each other’s eulogy; one of us is going to die first.”

Coach Tom Coughlin's Giants started the season 5-0 but have lost their last three games.

Bono, a motivational speaker and former insurance agent who lives in Florida, met Coughlin when Coughlin was coaching the Jacksonville Jaguars. He said they talked at length once or twice a week by telephone about families, religion, politics and possibly a little football.

Last month, they discussed the funeral in Philadelphia of Bono’s mother. Bono was grieving and needed guidance. Coughlin told Bono to drive through his old neighborhood first.

Coughlin told Bono to remember the good times and go into the funeral with that in mind. Bono said the advice worked.

“He coached me through it,” Bono said. “It gave me peace.”

Coughlin, who seldom displays his intimate side in public, is dealing this week with something less than a life-and-death matter, but it is a football crisis.

His Giants started the season 5-0 but have lost their last three games. At times, they have seemed confused and discouraged. If the Giants (5-3) lose at home on Sunday to San Diego (4-3), they will begin their bye week in their worst slump in three years.

Back then, in Coughlin’s early years of running the Giants, some players — like Jeremy Shockey and Tiki Barber — said after defeats that the Giants were outcoached.

Those players are no longer with the team, and the current group has voiced no such public criticism, although leaders of the defense have spoken recently of communication problems.

General Manager Jerry Reese said Thursday in an e-mail message, “Sure, these last three games are a concern, but I believe it’s a little too early to call it a crisis.”

Since starting last season 11-1, the Giants have gone 6-7, including a playoff defeat. After their 40-17 loss at Philadelphia on Sunday, Coughlin groped for answers.

He said his players had fundamental problems like “basic tackling and basic getting off blocks” on defense and protecting the ball from turnovers on offense.

When asked if he knew why such basic things were problems at midseason, Coughlin replied: “Not really. I don’t know. I don’t have the answer for that right now.”

Coughlin, through a team spokesman, declined to be interviewed about the slump. The team president John Mara was not made available despite a request for an interview.

The last time Coughlin’s Giants lost four straight was in 2006, when his job was in jeopardy. After complaints from his players about his strict approach, Coughlin changed a few things. He formed a “leadership council” of players, and the Giants won the 2008 Super Bowl.

The current 14-member council met with him last week and met again on Friday. Justin Tuck said the meeting was “cool, very brief.”

Another member, defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka, refused even to discuss the leadership council and offered a cryptic response when asked about Coughlin’s approach to getting out of the slump.

“I respectfully decline to answer that question, I’m going to stay away from that,” said Kiwanuka, who is generally one of the most forthcoming Giants.

Cornerback Terrell Thomas said of Coughlin: “His mentality has changed a little bit. He’s like a dad that’s going to harp on you with tough love.”

Coughlin called his leadership council meetings “an information-sharing thing from me to them,” with an occasional question from the players.

He said his team leaders needed to lift the Giants. Two of them on the defense, Antonio Pierce and Tuck, spoke to reporters in recent days about communication problems.

Coughlin said those problems could be solved. But Bill Sheridan, the first-year defensive coordinator, said Thursday that he was not aware of any communication problems.

“You have to ask them,” Sheridan said of his players. “I don’t know what they’re talking about.”

Pierce said he was happy to hear that Coughlin told reporters the best players must lead and lift the team.

“I’m glad he called us out,” Pierce said. “I love it.”

Bono, Coughlin’s friend in Florida, said Coughlin was easy to talk to and had a sense of humor but appeared strict in his coaching role because “he’s got to discipline guys making $6 million a year.”

Bono got to know Coughlin through a mutual friend when Coughlin moved to Jacksonville in 1994. He is involved with several church groups and said of Coughlin: “Certainly he has priestlike qualities. A good priest is a good leader and motivational, somebody who inspires you.”

Bono said Coughlin understands that life occasionally takes on negative momentum that cannot be easily understood.

“Sometimes, you don’t have answers,” Bono said. “It’s the way the ball bounces.”
