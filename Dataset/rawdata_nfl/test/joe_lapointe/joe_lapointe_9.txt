In the final two minutes of the Eagles’ 40-17 victory over the Giants on Sunday, the hosts tried to end the embarrassment mercifully.

Donovan McNabb fell to one knee after a first-down snap to run down the clock without scoring anymore or risking anyone’s health.

But Giants Coach Tom Coughlin refused to concede. He called timeouts, forcing the Eagles to run plays and then punt.

When the Giants got the ball back, Coughlin used Eli Manning until the last snap, on which Manning was sacked.

It was a curious ending to a game in which the Giants had shown little urgency or tempo when they still had a faint chance to win.

Manning, who threw two more interceptions (and has five in his last two games), was asked if his coach was sending a message to his team, which lost its third consecutive game after opening the season with five victories.

“I don’t know,” Manning said. “We’re going to go fighting. If Coach wants us to finish a game, we’re going to give it a shot. You kind of get to the point where you don’t look at the scoreboard.”

The board showed the Giants behind by 7 points after 94 seconds, by 23 at halftime and by 26 early in the third quarter.

They looked dazed and confused in many ways. On offense, Manning — who denied that his right heel was bothering him — consistently overthrew receivers, even when open.

On defense, the secondary gave up three more touchdown passes. “We recognized the way the safeties played,” McNabb said, and he took advantage.

On special teams, the Giants gave up a 35-yard return on the opening kickoff. At the start of the second half, Domenik Hixon turned the ball over on a fumble.

Coughlin, who said his team was in a “funk,” was asked about prolonging the conclusion of a lost cause. “We’re going to fight to the very end,” he said.

When someone asked him whether he was at his wits’ end, Coughlin replied, “I’m not at my wits’ end; I’m just as frustrated as the next guy.”

Middle linebacker Antonio Pierce, the leader of the defense, called the Giants’ plight “a complete embarrassment and disappointment.”

He added, “I don’t know if I’m frustrated or just mind-boggled.”

He also said, “We’re not communicating,” although he would not be specific. It appeared that the Giants’ defensive backs were not always certain whom to cover.

This partly explained McNabb’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Brent Celek, his 54-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson and his 23-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Maclin.

The Eagles played without Brian Westbrook, the star running back and Giants tormentor. But this game fell apart early, and Giants fans must wonder whether that will be the case for the season, now halfway played.

“I’m not pointing fingers,” Pierce said. “I’m not saying ‘this guy’ or ‘this coach.’ ” One of the coaches is Bill Sheridan, the first-year defensive coordinator.

Sheridan will next be available for questions Thursday. But it appears that the loss of safety Kenny Phillips to season-ending knee surgery has weakened the cohesion of the secondary.

His replacement has been C. C. Brown. Cornerback Corey Webster said, “There can be some lapse of communication between players” and added, “we definitely are angry.”

Mathias Kiwanuka, a defensive end, said that Pierce was telling players their assignments and that “if there are communication problems, it is not Pierce, but there are breakdowns somewhere else.”

Coughlin also faulted the tackling, which allowed touchdown runs of 41 yards by Leonard Weaver and 66 yards by LeSean McCoy. “Don’t miss tackles in the open field,” Coughlin said.

Manning completed 20 of 39 passes for 222 yards. He was sacked twice and treated rudely by the Eagles.

In the fourth quarter, when Manning scrambled out of the pocket, he was flung out of bounds to the ground by Jason Babin, who was penalized.

Manning, who injured his right foot four weeks ago at Kansas City, again denied that the injury had affected his throwing. He was asked whether he considered himself in a slump.

“I don’t know,” Manning said. “I’m not going to label it as that. I can play better. I have to play better.”

His center, Shaun O’Hara, was asked whether he thought Coughlin was making a point by calling late timeouts and leaving Manning exposed.

“I don’t know what point that would be,” O’Hara said. “That comes from the top. That’s the way Coach is.”
