In a secluded corner of the practice field on Thursday, loud grunts of large Giants mixed with the pop of their pads smacking into tackling dummies.

The sounds came from the defensive linemen, who had zero sacks in a decisive defeat at New Orleans last Sunday. They hope to improve that statistic Sunday night when Arizona visits Giants Stadium.

Although Thursday’s drill was routine, the intensity seemed enhanced. “There was definitely more energy,” end Mathias Kiwanuka said.

“We’re a little angry,” end Osi Umenyiora said.

Bill Sheridan, the first-year defensive coordinator, said he should have helped his linemen against the Saints with more blitzes from his linebackers and defensive backs.

“Should have, would have, could have,” Sheridan said. “We should have just pressured more. Not only more frequently, but send more guys.”

When asked if the Giants (5-1) would blitz more against the Cardinals (3-2) and future opponents, Sheridan replied, “Yes, absolutely.”

Technically, the Giants’ defense still ranks first in the N.F.L., with a league-low average of 257.7 yards allowed per game. But the Saints gained 493 — 360 in the air — in a 48-27 victory.

And it was not the first difficult outing for Sheridan’s defense. In the second game, a 33-31 victory at Dallas, the Giants gave up 378 yards, including 251 rushing.

“Since the Dallas game, we had played well,” Sheridan said.

They will probably not worry much about the Cardinals’ ground game. They average only 57.6 rushing yards, tied for last in the N.F.L.

But Kurt Warner and Larry Fitzgerald lead an air attack that is sixth at 280.2 yards per game and last winter reached the Super Bowl.

“I’m sure they will be licking their chops coming in against us, feeling they will be able to throw the ball all over the park,” Sheridan said.

Drew Brees and the Saints did that by luring linebackers and safeties toward the line with fake handoffs.

And the pass defenders sometimes seemed a step slower and a foot lower than the receivers who sped past and leaped above them.

One victim was C. C. Brown, a free-agent safety who became a starter when Kenny Phillips was sidelined with knee surgery. Brown might have to help cover Fitzgerald, who, Brown said, “positions his body well” and “makes his money off deep balls.” Brown’s approach, he said, could be like a basketball technique.

Brown described it as “trying to rebound.” He and other safeties have drilled this week on leaping for high passes, the kind Fitzgerald likes.

There also might be more playing time for Aaron Rouse, a backup safety signed off waivers from Green Bay on Sept. 24.

“Obviously, I just got here,” Rouse said. “It’s my first loss experience with this team. We all know we didn’t play our best game. We’re focused.”

Terrell Thomas, the second-year cornerback, said the problems in the secondary should not be too hard to solve.

“Just be more aggressive, more alert,” Thomas said. “Once we do that, it will be a different outcome.”

They would be helped by pressure on Warner. Defensive end Justin Tuck said, “We don’t have time to feel sorry for ourselves or lick our wounds.”

He noted that Warner was releasing the ball more quickly this season and settling for shorter gains through the air; the Cardinals have given up just 10 sacks in five games.

“They’re still putting up a lot of points,” Tuck said. “They’re still doing something right.”

Sheridan, who coached the linebackers last season, has had at least two small disruptions in his new role.

Before the season, middle linebacker Antonio Pierce successfully lobbied against Sheridan’s plan to call plays from the coaching booth instead of the sideline.

Later, Umenyiora walked out of practice after a dispute with Sheridan but returned a few hours later and apologized.

Sheridan said Thursday that he was comfortable on the field, although he also said “it is not as great of a view” as the one upstairs.

But his aides up there tell him clearly what they see, he said. “It is an irrelevant issue,” Sheridan said. “Being on the field is fine.”
