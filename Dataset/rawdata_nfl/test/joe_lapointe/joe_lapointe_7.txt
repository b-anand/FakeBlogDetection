Three key members of the Giants’ defense reported progress in their recoveries from injuries Wednesday and expressed hope that they could play soon.

Chris Canty, the defensive lineman, said he practiced fully and has recovered from a calf injury. He said he expected to be available Sunday when the Giants (5-3) try to break a three-game losing streak; they host the San Diego Chargers (4-3) at Giants Stadium.

Michael Boley, the linebacker, said he practiced partially in his rehabilitation from knee surgery and might play against the Chargers.

Aaron Ross, the cornerback who has been out all season with a hamstring injury, did not practice and said he would not be ready. But the Giants have a bye week after the Chargers game and Ross said he was hoping to play against Atlanta in the following game on Nov. 22.

Canty, a free-agent acquisition from Dallas, has been out since playing the first game of the season. “I’m fresh, I feel really good, I’m excited,” Canty said. “I definitely feel I can contribute. I’m preparing as if I’m going to play this week. I’m a better football player than cheerleader.”

Boley, signed as a free agent from Atlanta, missed the opener with a suspension, played the next three games and missed the most recent four after arthroscopic knee surgery.

“I’m taking it one day at a time,” Boley said. “It went pretty good. I was able to take some reps.”

Ross, in his third season, has had the hamstring problem since training camp and aggravated it while trying to come back. He worked out alone at the side of the practice field Wednesday and seemed upbeat afterward.

“I feel great,” he said.

Athletes often say with hamstring injuries that it is better to wait longer even after they feel better because they aren’t really healed even when they first feel healed.

“That’s what I learned after I kept trying to come back,” Ross said. “Wait an extra week, which is sort of hard.”

Canty, Boley and Ross represent the three distinct zones of the defense. In the last three games, the Giants have given up 48 points to New Orleans, 24 to Arizona and 40 to Philadelphia.

Antonio Pierce, the middle linebacker and captain of the defense, said last Sunday that the defense had communication problems.

He said Wednesday that players in the fourth quarter still wonder what went wrong in the first. He also used the word “laughingstock” to describe how the defense was playing.

“Sometimes, you have to go above X’s and O’s and play harder,” Pierce said. “Show some kind of spirit. We don’t want to see our season pass by us.”

At times, the secondary seems confused about whom to cover. The Giants also gave up a touchdown against the Eagles after the front seven presented a lopsided alignment.

Pierce is the one who calls the signals and sets the formations.

“I’m probably the biggest culprit,” Pierce said. “I’ve been called the leader of the defense. I need to do a better job.”
