If the Giants (5-4) keep playing the way they did against San Diego on Sunday, they could win more games than they lose over the final seven and might even make the playoffs.

This hunch is counterintuitive in New York’s manic-depressive sports culture because the Chargers’ 21-20 victory left the Giants with their fourth consecutive loss and their fans befuddled. But a slumping team sometimes loses a game it should win before it reverses its momentum. As with a patient in a sickbed, the fever breaks, but the illness must still run its course.

Defensive end Osi Umenyiora offered the curious observation.

“I’m definitely panicked right now, but it is not something we should let get into the psyche of everybody else,” Umenyiora said, adding that the Giants were “still one of the best teams in the N.F.L.”

“The Giants are comfortable,” he said. “We have our backs against the wall. We always come out swinging.”

He may be right. Consider one significant team statistic from Sunday: The Giants controlled the ball for 37 minutes 47 seconds; the Chargers had it 22:13 but won with a last-minute touchdown pass. Consider a significant individual statistic: Giants receiver Steve Smith leads the N.F.L. with 61 catches and is fourth in receiving yardage with 719. He is not just “the other Steve Smith” anymore.

Smith caught eight passes Sunday from Eli Manning, who came out of a personal slump. At the request of his coaches, Manning threw more short- and middle-range passes instead of going deep.

“Sometimes, when you’re out of sync, it’s important to get into a rhythm,” said Manning, who had no interceptions Sunday after throwing six in his previous three games.

The running attack may be emerging. Brandon Jacobs, who has not rushed for 100 yards in a game since Nov. 9, 2008, had 67 yards on 11 carries Sunday (he is averaging 4.1 yards per carry). He still jaws a lot at opponents, fans and even cheerleaders, but in recent weeks he has also shown the explosiveness that was missing even when the Giants started 5-0.

On defense, the “communication” problems some players spoke about last week were minimized in part by the replacement of C. C. Brown in the secondary with Aaron Rouse.

There was still a burst of arm-gesturing anger by Antonio Pierce toward his fellow linebacker Danny Clark after a touchdown pass by the Chargers’ Philip Rivers.

Pierce chose not to elaborate Monday about the play. “They scored a touchdown,” Pierce said three times. When pressed, he added only, “I was upset because they scored.”

Clark’s young backup, Clint Sintim, took a few snaps. Pierce’s young backup, Jonathan Goff, delivered one of the game’s hardest hits on kickoff coverage. Coach Tom Coughlin was asked if Goff, too, had earned a chance to appear on defense.

“He’s a young, developing guy,” Coughlin said. “We look forward to continuing that development.”

Although Coughlin said linebacker Michael Boley and lineman Chis Canty were rusty in returning from injuries, they helped the Giants, who had allowed 112 points in their previous three games.

Coughlin and his staff might have been too tentative late in the game by not passing for the end zone when the Giants had a chance to increase their lead from 3 points to 10.

Even Phil Simms, the former Giants quarterback now announcing for CBS, said on a third-and-goal situation, “I have no doubt the Giants will throw the football here.”

“You try to win the game,” Simms said. But Jacobs ran to the 4-yard line to set up a field goal. Coughlin said Manning had a pass option on the play.

“The game was there to be won,” Coughlin said. “A touchdown there would have made a huge difference.”

On Sunday, he said, “You can second-guess it all you want.”

Because of a bye, the Giants have two weeks to relax, study and heal a few wounds, physical and psychological.

By the next game, cornerback Aaron Ross may finally return from his hamstring injury to bolster the struggling secondary. Jeff Feagles has time to break a punting (and snap-holding) slump. Running back Ahmad Bradshaw can soothe his broken toe; so can tight end Kevin Boss and his much-bumped noggin and tackle Kareem McKenzie and his aches and pains.

Last season, defending a Super Bowl championship, the Giants started 11-1 before fading to 1-3 in the stretch. Many players repeated Monday that it mattered most how a team finished.

But it will be difficult. Beginning with Atlanta, their next four opponents are a combined 22-10.

“We have faith that we are a good offensive line,” center Shaun O’Hara said. “We have faith that we have good running backs and good receivers. We have faith that we have good coaches.”

He then added: “We have faith in our team and the way we go about things. We have faith in our preparation. And we have faith in this organization.”
