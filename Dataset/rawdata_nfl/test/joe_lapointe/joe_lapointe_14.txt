On the first play of the Giants’ season, Danny Ware returned a kickoff 17 yards but injured his elbow when he was tackled and has not played since.

After that, the Giants struggled to fill the kickoff-returner role. Sinorice Ross did most of it and performed without distinction.

But last Sunday, in a mostly dreary 48-27 defeat at New Orleans, the Giants seemed to find a solution hiding in plain sight. He was Domenik Hixon, who returned seven kickoffs for 230 yards.

Hixon, a wide receiver, is expected back in the return role Sunday night when the Giants (5-1) host the Arizona Cardinals (3-2).

“It was exciting and fun,” Hixon said of his New Orleans showing. “I could feel the emotion. When you get a big return early, you kind of get a little bit of confidence.”

Few plays in sports generate greater danger and more explosive potential than kickoff returns.

As 22 large men risk high-speed collisions, a ball carrier can score 6 points, alter a game’s momentum, excite thousands of spectators and earn glory on television highlight shows.

Moreover, a long runback endears a returner to his 10 blockers on special teams, players who usually serve in backup roles on the offense or the defense.

William Beatty, a rookie offensive tackle, said “it’s a pleasure to block for” Hixon on kickoffs because “he makes your blocks look good; he’s usually not behind me too long.”

Gerris Wilkinson, a reserve linebacker, said Hixon “makes you want to hold on to your block a little longer” because the effort might pay off both on the field and off.

“He told me he would buy me something but to keep it in his price range,” Wilkinson said. “I think it will be a meal at Applebee’s.”

In addition to kickoff returns last week, Hixon ran back two punts for 51 yards and gained 22 yards on three receptions for a cumulative total of 303 yards.

That distance of more than three football fields broke the franchise record of 279 yards set in 1948 by Joe Scott against the Los Angeles Rams.

But multiple kickoff returns are a mixed blessing. Kevin Boothe, a reserve offensive lineman, said most of them come after the opposition has scored.

“So it’s not necessarily a good thing to get so many chances,” Boothe said. “But it is a good chance to shift the momentum in your favor.”

Hixon had returned kickoffs before last Sunday — 20 in 2007 as a rookie with Denver and the Giants and three last season for a career average of 29.3 yards.

During training camp, Hixon was considered a favorite for one of two first-string roles at wide receiver to replace Plaxico Burress and Amani Toomer.

But Hixon injured his knee in the second game at Dallas and did not touch the ball again until last Sunday, when his longest return was 68 yards.

Another went for 45 and might have been a touchdown had he not been brought down in the middle of the field on an arm tackle by kicker Thomas Morstead.

“Next time, that won’t happen,” Hixon said. “I didn’t make a move at all. I just tried to run by him.”

Although Hixon may not be considered first string among a surprisingly productive group of receivers, he certainly has earned the attention of Coach Tom Coughlin.

“He gives us a real nice lift,” Coughlin said. “Extremely reliable. He does whatever you ask him to do. He is a real pro. He is something else.”

Hixon, who celebrated his 25th birthday Oct. 8, is the son of an African-American father and a German mother. His father was in the Army, and Hixon lived in Germany until age 12.

In Hixon’s first N.F.L. game, with Denver, he returned a kickoff and collided helmet-to-helmet with Kevin Everett of the Bills, who sustained a spinal fracture on the play.

“That was something that got to me,” Hixon told The Daily News last season.

It took awhile — and a change of teams — for Hixon to return to effectiveness as a returner.

He seems to have found his stride. Linebacker Bryan Kehl, a regular on special teams, said Hixon ran “on instinct, sheer instinct; it’s something you really can’t teach.”

“And now you see a guy who’s got a chance to shine,” Kehl said. “He’s just taking it and running with it, both literally and figuratively.”
