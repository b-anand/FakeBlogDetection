When San Diego chose Eli Manning first over all in the 2004 N.F.L. draft, the Chargers gave him a jersey that he handed to his mother.

Eli Manning and Philip Rivers were the keys to a draft-day trade in 2004 between the New York Giants and San Diego Chargers.

Less than an hour later, after the Chargers traded Manning to the Giants, his mother, Olivia, asked him, “You want me to give this away?” Manning shook his head. “Keep it,” he told her.

As the Giants (5-3) prepared to play the Chargers (4-3) on Sunday afternoon at Giants Stadium, Manning was asked about that jersey with the lightning bolt.

“Yeah, my parents still have it,” Manning said with a half-smile. “It’s at home in New Orleans, somewhere. I haven’t seen it in a while.”

Manning will see plenty of Chargers jerseys Sunday, including one worn by Philip Rivers, the quarterback who was selected by the Giants in the first round of the same draft and traded with three draft picks for Manning.

They are friendly peers, text-messaging each other with compliments and encouragement. But Sunday will be their first meeting on an N.F.L. field.

“I know Philip,” Manning said. “It’s a fraternity between quarterbacks. He is a great player, great person.”

They first met at a Manning family quarterback camp in Louisiana that included Manning’s brother Peyton, and his father, Archie.

“It was really a first-class camp,” Rivers said last week. “It was fun just getting to know them a little bit.”

At the time, Manning was playing at Mississippi and Rivers at North Carolina State. Rivers said he was impressed by the way Manning threw the ball.

“It just flew out of his hand,” Rivers said. “Certainly, we are intertwined based on that draft-day trade and how it all unfolded. I would like to think it has worked out for both of us.”

Manning, who led the Giants to a Super Bowl title after the 2007 season, comes into Sunday’s game in a slump. He has thrown six interceptions during the Giants’ current three-game losing streak.

Manning is listed as probable with a lingering injury to his right foot that might have limited his effectiveness in recent games, although he has insisted it is not to blame.

Of his state of mind and that of his team, Manning said: “You can’t get down on yourself. You can’t start doubting yourself or doubting your teammates.”

Slumps, Manning said, are a “part of sports” and players must “never lose faith and confidence.” Asked if Giants players spoke of it in team meetings, Manning replied, “If we did, I wouldn’t tell you.”

Statistical quarterback ratings put Rivers ahead of Manning this season. Rivers is 10th with a 95.9 rating; Manning is 15th at 86.4. Rivers has 11 touchdown passes in seven games; Manning has 13 in eight.

The other star quarterback from their draft class is Ben Roethlisberger, chosen 11th over all by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Roethlisberger, with two Super Bowl championships, is sixth in the quarterback ratings this year.

Since Rivers took over as the first-string quarterback in 2006, the Chargers are 37-18 in regular-season play. But legacies are made by reaching and winning the Super Bowl.

“Among those three, I’m the one that hasn’t gotten there,” Rivers said. “Nothing could give me any more drive or motivate me any harder.”

He called himself “the odd man out, at least this far.”

A look back to their draft recalls a day of intrigue and power politics. In the four previous seasons, the Chargers were 18-46 and the Manning family was against Eli going to San Diego.

A. J. Smith, the Chargers’ general manager, said at the time: “It brought to light the humiliation or the lowliness that people had for our organization, particularly the Manning family. They wanted no part of us.”

Archie Manning warned that if the Chargers drafted Eli, his son might sit out the 2004 season and go into the 2005 draft.

But San Diego made the most of its opportunity. In addition to swapping quarterbacks, the Chargers got the Giants’ third-round pick that draft and their first and fifth picks in 2005.

The draft was held at Madison Square Garden. Manning was booed by New York fans when he was announced as the No. 1 pick, but cheered hours later at Giants Stadium when introduced there after the trade.

“I didn’t dictate this,” Manning said at the time, adding that he learned of the trade from “a little kid” backstage and that “I thought he might be joking.”

Rivers had played in the Senior Bowl before the draft for Marty Schottenheimer, then the San Diego coach. He spent draft day in Raleigh, N.C., washing his car in a Chargers T-shirt.

In the aftermath of the trade, Manning replaced the veteran Kurt Warner, now starring in Arizona, and Rivers replaced Drew Brees, now starring in New Orleans.

The Chargers used two of the picks they acquired from the Giants to draft linebacker Shawne Merriman and kicker Nate Kaeding. In many ways, it was a classic trade that helped both teams.

But while Manning plays late-season games in the blustery winds of the Meadowlands in the intense New York region, Rivers spends most of his time in balmy, relaxed Southern California.

“It seems to be a little more laid back out here on the West Coast, which fits me,” Rivers said. “I am kind of a low-key, family man who likes to lay low. It is not a bad place to be.”
