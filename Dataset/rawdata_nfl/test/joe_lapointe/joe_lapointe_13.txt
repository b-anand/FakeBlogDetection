 Giants tight end Kevin Boss said Monday that he did not sustain a concussion when he was hit on the head during the team’s 24-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday night.

Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said he was not pleased with all the adjustments Eli Manning was making at the line of scrimmage. 

But Boss, who was hit helmet to helmet by safety Antrel Rolle after a 25-yard reception with 4 minutes 45 seconds to play, said, “It feels like I’ve gotten in a car wreck.”

“Anytime you get hit that hard, definitely the lights turn off for a second,” Boss said. “But I came to pretty quick.”

No penalty was called on the play.

Eli Manning escaped unscathed physically, but he threw three interceptions and took two delay-of-game penalties as the Giants (5-2) lost their second consecutive game.

Coach Tom Coughlin suggested strongly Monday that Manning should simplify his thought process at the line of scrimmage and not make so many adjustments before the snap.

“It slowed us down,” Coughlin said. “I don’t want to play like that. I don’t like that tempo. I don’t like delay of game at all. There’s no reason for it. At some point, the chess game is over and you live with what’s there.”

Manning was asked if he sometimes overthought and overadjusted at the line while trying to improve upon the play called by his coaches.

“I try to put our team in good plays,” Manning said. “Sometimes I’m wrong. Sometimes I’m right. Defenses try to confuse you. If they win the battle of confusing you, you can still make a successful play out of it.”

Yes, the Giants seemed on edge as they prepared to play at Philadelphia on Sunday. The Cardinals (4-2) got the best not only of Manning but also of running back Ahmad Bradshaw, who lost a fumble right after Boss’s catch.

Bradshaw had gained 14 yards and struggled for more when the ball was stripped from his hands when it might have been wiser for him to accept the inevitable tackle.

“That loses games,” Bradshaw said of the fumble with 3 minutes 52 seconds remaining. “I planned on going down. I’ve got to practice on keeping that second hand on the ball.”

When the Giants got the ball back, Bradshaw was penalized for unnecessary roughness after punching Darnell Dockett’s helmet after a tackle.

“I don’t worry about Bradshaw,” Dockett, a defensive tackle, said. “I’ve been in tougher fights in my life. I guess he was thinking that he was going to have more than 100 yards.”

Bradshaw, who gained 32 yards on 12 carries, was asked if Dockett’s words provoked him.

“He was just in my face,” Bradshaw said. “I was trying to excuse him from my face.”

That drive ended when Rolle intercepted Manning’s final pass, intended for Steve Smith when Smith was double-covered and other Giants might have been open.

Speaking in general about interceptions, Coughlin said: “‘Your eyes have to tell you perhaps it’s not a great idea to try to fit that ball in there. Your heart gets torn out of you.”

Manning threw for 243 yards and completed 19 of 37 passes, three of them to Boss for 35 yards. Cardinals linebacker Gerald Hayes said of Manning, “We tried to get him confused, get him rattled.”

Boss, who was rattled physically, said his wife and grandmother were at the game and were most upset about his injury. He said Monday that he felt soreness around his neck and left shoulder.

But Boss said he did not blame Rolle. “He’s going for the ball, just trying to make a play,” Boss said. “I think I should be fine.”
