 In his final moment on the field Sunday at Giants Stadium, San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers fired a dart through the heart of the Giants' defense and maybe their hopes for the season.

It was an 18-yard touchdown pass to Vincent Jackson with 21 seconds left that gave his Chargers a 21-20 victory.

For Giants quarterback Eli Manning -- his name entwined with Rivers's in N.F.L. history since their draft day trade in 2004 --his last moment Sunday was less glorious but just as emphatic.

With one play left to steal a victory, five seconds remaining on the clock and the San Diego end zone 71 yards away, Manning dropped back to pass.

But he was sacked for the fifth time of the game, this one by Shawne Merriman, one of several players obtained by the Chargers through their trade of Manning for Rivers.

The result improved San Diego's record to 5-3 and dropped the Giants' to 5-4 with their fourth consecutive defeat. It is one they will dwell on for two weeks, with a bye next weekend.

When Manning was asked whether his team had ''hit bottom,'' he replied, ''No, we haven't hit bottom,'' but Manning did not mean to imply that things will get still worse.

''When you hit bottom, that is when you see guys quitting,'' Manning said. ''We didn't quit.''

Indeed, the Giants battled back from a 7-point deficit and took their first lead with 8 minutes 58 seconds left in the game when Manning connected with Kevin Boss on an 8-yard touchdown for a 17-14 lead. It was Manning's second touchdown pass of the day.

The Giants could have increased their lead to 10 soon after had they taken advantage of Terrell Thomas's 33-yard interception return to the San Diego 4. But after guard Chris Snee was penalized for holding, Coach Tom Coughlin called three cautious plays that set up the second field goal of the game by Lawrence Tynes with 2:11 left to put the Giants ahead by 20-14.

''You can second-guess it all you want,'' Coughlin said.

This gave the Chargers enough time for an 80-yard touchdown drive that included six completions by Rivers, the final when Jackson got behind cornerback Corey Webster's man-to-man coverage on the right side. It was Rivers's third touchdown pass of the day and second to Jackson.

''We'll be O.K. in the long run,'' Webster said. ''We've got to keep fighting and get the bad taste out of our mouths.''

Thomas, who almost scored on his tackle-dodging interception runback, said: ''We left a lot of points on the field, defensively and offensively. It's very frustrating and humbling. That's the way the cookie crumbles.''

In many ways, the Giants looked better than they did in their previous defeats to New Orleans, Arizona and Philadelphia.

The defense was bolstered by the return from injury of lineman Chris Canty and linebacker Michael Boley. Aaron Rouse replaced C. C. Brown in the defensive backfield, which seemed more cohesive.

The Giants sacked Rivers twice and decisively shut down two Chargers drives to force punts in the fourth quarter before ending their third drive on the interception by Thomas. San Diego managed only 34 yards rushing on 15 carries.

On offense, Manning completed 25 of 33 passes for 215 yards. Steve Smith caught eight passes and Mario Manningham six. Manning avoided the interceptions that plagued him in recent games.

Brandon Jacobs gained 67 yards on 11 carries in one of his most authoritative performances this season. Jacobs and others tried afterward to speak optimistically through their frustration.

''This was a game we definitely needed,'' Jacobs said. ''It's getting close to where it's pretty much win or die.''

Defensive end Justin Tuck called the defeat ''one of the most difficult ones I've ever been a part of'' and said the Giants played well for ''three and three-quarters quarters'' but not quite the full four.

''We're professionals,'' Tuck said. ''Ain't no quit in us.''

Tuck took encouragement from last season's Arizona Cardinals, surprising participants in the Super Bowl, saying, ''Who at this point in time last year would have said Arizona would make the Super Bowl?''
