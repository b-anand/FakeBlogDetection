Danny Clark of the Giants says he gets a lot of long looks from curious motorists when he drives his Smart car between Manhattan and the team’s practice complex in New Jersey.

But the glances turn to stares and smiles when he parks his 1,600-pound vehicle and his 6-foot-2, 245-pound body emerges from behind the wheel.

“That’s when the real mystery comes about,” Clark said. “They say, ‘How does this big guy get out of such a small car?’ Other drivers are quite surprised. They can’t believe it.”

Clark, a veteran linebacker, parks in a players lot among pickup trucks, Hummers and Escalades. He said he was “thinking outside the box” to be different and environmentally friendly.

“I did the whole S.U.V. thing my first couple years in the N.F.L.,” Clark said. “I’ve chosen to go against the grain a little bit and help out our one and only environment. The ‘Green Giant’ is my name. Get it? Green.”

Clark said he also recycled cans and bottles in his effort to be ecologically friendly. His car seats two people and can park in tight spaces impossible for most vehicles. His teammates regard Clark’s car with wonder.

A few players have ridden with him, but not Kareem McKenzie, a 6-6, 327-pound tackle.

“No,” McKenzie said. “I don’t try and get in anything that weighs almost as much as me.”

But Domenik Hixon, a wide receiver who is 6-2 and 185 pounds, said he found Clark’s car surprisingly spacious.

“I had enough leg room and stuff,” Hixon said. “That car is very unique.”

But it is relatively light. Clark said he drove his teammate Zak DeOssie (6-4, 249 pounds) to practice last week and noticed immediately the shift in weight balance when steering.

During training camp, Clark said, his teammates teased him by telling him they were going to pick up his car and put it in the back of Dave Tollefson’s pickup truck.

Clark would not let them. “Nobody touches my car,” Clark said. His is gray with tinted windows and a moon roof.

Clark was asked about the crash-safety factor in a car that is one-quarter of the weight of some passenger vehicles. “It’s built like a little rubber ball, like a little cage,” he said. “The windshield actually pops out instead of going in. I definitely did my research.”

Clark said the basic price for the car is about $16,000, but his cost more because he added many luxury touches. “All the works,” he said. “It’s definitely dressed up.”

Bryan Kehl, a 6-2, 240-pound linebacker, said he rode with Clark in the Smart car and found it “really cool.”

“It is actually funny, because I wanted to get a Smart car and I talked about it all the time,” Kehl said. “But now he beat me to the punch. So I can’t get one because people will think I’m copying him. I’m jealous.”
