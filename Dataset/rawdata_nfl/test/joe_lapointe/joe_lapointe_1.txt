The Jets lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars, 24-22, on Sunday on a last-second field goal that ended a surreal two-minute drill filled with cold calculation by both sides.

Maurice Joes-Drew intentionally dropped to his knee before the end zone after a 9-yard gain to run time off the clock and set up the winning kick. 

Mark Sanchez was 16 of 30 for 212 passing yards, including a touchdown, but he also threw two interceptions as the Jets lost for the fifth time in six games. 

This was the Jets’ fifth defeat in their last six games as their early-season bluster has been replaced by recriminations.

But for neutral observers, Sunday’s finishing sequence at Giants Stadium was both unorthodox and memorable. It included a Jets defense trying to allow a touchdown to give Jacksonville the lead and the Jaguars refusing to score it. And it had nothing to do with either team trying to lose.

Jaguars running back Maurice Jones-Drew, one of the stars of the game, intentionally dropped to his knee before the end zone after a 9-yard gain to set up the winning field goal while running time off the clock.

Mindful of what some fans care about most, Jones-Drew said, “Tell my fantasy owners I’m sorry.”

He did it to run down the clock because the Jets had no timeouts and the Jaguars did not want the Jets to get the ball back after what was to be a 21-yard field goal by Josh Scobee.

Jones-Drew already had one touchdown and 123 rushing yards. Another score by him would have meant valuable points to fans who drafted him for their fantasy leagues, but, he said, “I’d rather take a win any day.”

Still, when he was told not to score, Jones-Drew said he was surprised at first. “I’m like, a knee? What do you mean?” he said. “I took a deep breath and took a knee.”

What made it even stranger was the play before that. On first-and-10 from the Jets’ 14 with two minutes left, Jets Coach Rex Ryan told his defenders to let Jacksonville score. Ryan figured it would give the Jaguars a 6-point lead but leave his team time to take the ensuing kickoff and drive the field for a game-winning touchdown.

Because not all of his defenders got the message, Jones-Drew was tackled at the 10 by Marques Douglas and Sione Pouha after a 4-yard run.

“We couldn’t even get that right,” Ryan said.

That forced Ryan to use his last timeout. Jones-Drew dropped to a knee at the 1-yard line on the next play, and quarterback David Garrard knelt on the next two downs to waste more time and set up the winning kick.

The result left the Jaguars 5-4 and the Jets 4-5. If the two teams tie for a playoff berth, the tie breaker will be this game.

“We’re barely breathing for the playoffs,” Ryan said.

Earlier in the second half, the Jets had used up two timeouts — one by the offense, one by the defense — because they had 12 men on the field each time.

“Our guys have got to be smart,” Ryan said. “We’ve spent all our room for error. It’s ridiculous.”

In some ways, the whole game had a funhouse quality, filled with dramatic turnovers and dynamic turning points. During a brief span in the third quarter, the Jets lost the ball twice and the Jaguars once.

But in the fourth quarter, Mark Sanchez, the rookie quarterback, played like a cool veteran, leading a drive of 77 yards on 16 plays as the Jets took a 22-21 lead on a 1-yard run by Thomas Jones with 5 minutes 4 seconds left.

The Jets tried for a 2-point conversion, but Sanchez’s pass to Braylon Edwards was knocked loose by safety Reggie Nelson, who “put a helmet right in my ribs,” Edwards said.

Sanchez blamed himself. “Too soft of a throw,” he said. “I hurt us.”

Sanchez opened his news conference by reading from handwritten notes. He just celebrated his 23rd birthday and looked like the college student he could still be.

He is the youngest player on the team, a first-round draft choice, and his eyes seemed to flash with intensity 30 minutes after the last play. “I feel like playing again,” he said.

Sanchez threw an interception on the first play from scrimmage and another one later on. He finished with 16 completions in 30 attempts for 212 yards and a touchdown, a 7-yard play to Jerricho Cotchery that gave the Jets a 10-7 lead in the second quarter.

Garrard threw for one touchdown with no interceptions among his 16 completions in 26 attempts for 221 yards.

No pass was more important than his 33-yard completion to tight end Marcedes Lewis. It moved the ball to the Jets’ 14 with two minutes left to set up the decisive plays. Lewis was tackled by safety Kerry Rhodes.

Ryan was asked whether single coverage was intended. “I’ll just say this,” Ryan said in one of his least expansive answers, “he ended up in single coverage.”

Jim Leonhard, the other safety, offered more details. “I was trying to get the coverage switched,” Leonhard said. “It was loud. We struggled to communicate. But it was on me. I’ll take a lot of the blame. That really hurt us.”

The Jets did not play last weekend, and Ryan made the unusual decision to give his players six days off. He said last week that his decision would be judged by Sunday’s result.

Afterward, he acknowledged his vulnerability on that question. He also said, “We’ve got to learn to finish” and “we have no excuses” and “we’re not dead yet.”
