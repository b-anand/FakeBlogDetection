The road to the Bowl Championship Series title game will wind through the most remote college town in the Southeastern Conference during the next month. By hosting No. 2 Florida this weekend and No. 1 Alabama on Nov. 14, Mississippi State will make cameo appearances in the national championship conversation.

Dan Mullen was Tim Tebow's quarterbacks coach at Florida last season. Mississippi State plays the Gators on Saturday.

And the drop-ins by the SEC fat cats will showcase for Mississippi State’s first-year coach, Dan Mullen, exactly what he is chasing in one of the most difficult jobs in all of college sports.

When Mullen, 37, was hired by Mississippi State last year after spending four seasons as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Florida, he traded the Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow for a walk-on quarterback and went to a university with essentially half the athletic budget ($41 million compared with $89 million) and football budget (less than $8 million compared with $15.8 million).

There is even a coordinator in the SEC, Tennessee’s Monte Kiffin, who is scheduled to make $300,000 more than Mullen’s $1.2 million salary this season.

But as Mississippi State has shown pluck and promise by starting 3-4 in Mullen’s rookie year, he has embraced his new home on the other side of the SEC’s financial tracks.

“Maybe people would wonder why you come here, but when I did the research and looked at the talent within a five-hour radius, the vision of the athletic director and a new president, I felt like we could build a winning program here,” Mullen said.

The tale of Mississippi State’s recent football history includes losses (two winning seasons this decade) and N.C.A.A. rules violations. Mullen is in charge of rewriting the narrative.

Mississippi State had a shot to beat Louisiana State in September, but was stopped four times after having first-and-goal at the 2 in the final two minutes. And the Bulldogs played the ranked opponents Georgia Tech and Houston to the wire.

With a patchwork roster that includes one of the SEC’s best tailbacks, Anthony Dixon, but had enough holes that Mullen installed five junior college transfers as starters, there has been consistent effort and an improved offensive game plan. After finishing No. 113 nationally in total offense last year (274.9 yards a game), Mississippi State is No. 53 this year (390.3).

“What Dan is allowing us to do is put us in position to win those games,” said Mississippi State’s athletic director, Greg Byrne, who is inspired by success in outposts like Blacksburg, Va. (Virginia Tech), Corvallis, Ore. (Oregon State), and Eugene, Ore. (Oregon). “We feel like we’re in a very positive position for the long term.”

Mullen’s overhaul began with his strength coach, Matt Balis, who was such an important piece that Mullen said he would have considered not taking the job if Balis had not come. The next step has come with recruiting, especially of local talent.

“We need to be the Oakland A’s,” the associate athletic director Scott Stricklin said, referring to the drafting of undervalued players by the frugal Oakland baseball team.

Mullen said that Mississippi State’s senior class featured just one of the top 20 high school players in the state during their senior year. He said Mississippi State signed 14 of the top 20 last year and had numerous top in-state players orally committed for next year. Mississippi is the No. 2 state in the country in most N.F.L. players per capita.

Mullen points out that perhaps the three greatest players at their position in N.F.L. history — Brett Favre (Southern Mississippi), Walter Payton (Jackson State) and Jerry Rice (Mississippi Valley State) — all slipped through the recruiting cracks here.

“What an impressive hall of fame that would be,” Mullen said. “That’s part of what we have to do. That’s the positive part for me. The negative is that it hasn’t happened. The positive is that it could have.”

Mullen said that as a rural university, Mississippi State should appeal to in-state recruits; most of Mississippi’s two million residents live in rural areas.

The university also has a progressive racial history in recent years, from hiring Sylvester Croom, the SEC’s first African-American head football coach and Mullen’s predecessor, to becoming the first SEC team to play a team from the Southwestern Athletic Conference, made up of historically black universities, when it beat Jackson State in this season’s opener.

“We want to make Mississippi State the destination for kids in Mississippi,” Stricklin said. “We think we best represent the demographics of the state. We have the highest minority enrollment of any school in the SEC. We can be the school that best represents the people of this state.”

Mullen is a New Hampshire native, but he and his wife, Megan, have felt welcome. Megan Mullen said that after the heartbreaking L.S.U. loss, 3,000 to 4,000 people were cheering and ringing their trademark cowbells as the Mullens drove away from the stadium.

“It made me tear up because they’re so darn good to him,” Megan Mullen said, adding, “To see people be that good to him, they know he’s going to turn it around and make winners here.”

Dan Mullen has practically gone door to door to let people know his plan. He said he went on such an intense monthlong speaking tour that at one point he ate catfish, hush puppies and cole slaw four consecutive meals.

That outreach helped rally the fan base. More than 31,000 people showed up for Mississippi State’s spring game, about 20,000 more than the previous high. With the Bulldogs coming off a four-win season, Mullen’s pitch helped season ticket sales hit a record high by more than 3,000. Mississippi State is also on track for its highest average attendance.

Mullen’s bosses attribute those numbers to his energy and vision, all of which he began applying after they hired him at 3 a.m. last December after a marathon interview.

“Our lives changed literally overnight,” Megan Mullen said. “And Dan hasn’t stopped shaking hands.”

And as Mullen looks across the field Saturday, he will see his mentor, Florida Coach Urban Meyer, and one of his favorite pupils,Tebow. Mullen said he spoke with Tebow after he sustained a concussion at Kentucky but had communicated with Meyer only through occasional text messages.

Although Mullen knows it is a long journey to make Starkville more than just a pit stop on the road to the national title, the next few weeks should offer a gauge of how far Mississippi State must travel.

“I took the job feeling that we could build a championship program here,” Mullen said. “That belief hasn’t changed.”
