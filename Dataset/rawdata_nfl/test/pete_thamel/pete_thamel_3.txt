As the sun rose in Eugene on Saturday, a man wearing the head of the University of Oregon’s duck mascot traversed the lines of fans gathered for ESPN’s “College GameDay” broadcast.

Oregon running back LaMichael James rushed 24 times for 183 yards against U.S.C. on Saturday night.

In a bit of Halloween trickery that could be a metaphor for Oregon’s unlikely season, the man underneath the duck mask was none other than Ducks Coach Chip Kelly.

As the sun set in Eugene, Kelly revealed the Oregon program to a national television audience by undressing Southern California and handing the Trojans their worst loss of the Pete Carroll era.

“They busted us,” U.S.C. safety Taylor Mays said after the 47-20 rout.

As Oregon scored touchdown after touchdown, filleting the mighty Trojans as if they were a weak opponent only collecting a check, it made the Ducks’ nightmarish opening loss to Boise State seem as if someone else had shown up for that game in the Ducks’ garish uniforms.

With No. 7 Oregon (7-1, 5-0) in control of the Pacific-10 race, the defining image of their season could come from players with roses in their teeth, not video of running back LeGarrette Blount’s sucker punch of a Boise State player after the loss.

Kelly made an inauspicious debut in that sloppy loss, but his reintroduction to the country came as he choked up in a news conference the next day. Kelly announced that Blount, perhaps Oregon’s best player, was suspended for the season. (Blount may be reinstated this week.) Despite the unrest, Kelly said he never doubted himself or the team.

“We lost, 19-8,” he said in a phone interview Sunday night. “We didn’t lose, 90-0.”

Watching this all unfold nearly 3,000 miles away, the Boston College receivers coach Ryan Day was not worried about Kelly, who had recruited Day and later coached with him at the University of New Hampshire.

Day had seen Kelly lose plenty of times before, in the early days trying to turn New Hampshire into a national power in the Football Championship Subdivision, then known as Division I-AA.

“When you get your butt kicked, that’s when you really see what people are made of,” Day said. “And with Chip, on Monday morning, he was always the same guy.”

Kelly and the entire Oregon program certainly took their punches in the news media in the days that followed. The Blount punch was replayed nearly as much as Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl halftime wardrobe malfunction.

Kelly said the positive from the loss and the incident was the outpouring from coaches around the country. Miami Coach Randy Shannon called to give advice about how the university handled its brawl with Florida International. The former Notre Dame coach Bob Davie checked in, as did Tony Dungy and Jon Gruden. Even P. J. Carlesimo, who knew Kelly from coaching basketball at New Hampshire College, talked to Kelly.

“The neat thing, to be honest with you, was how many people reached out to say hang in there,” Kelly said.

From there, Kelly showed the traits he picked up on his unconventional path to coaching stardom — accountability and creativity. He did all the right things away from the spotlight, even making the ultimate gesture of accountability by writing a personal check to a fan who wrote a letter demanding a refund for his trip to Boise.

Kelly’s on-field creativity comes from knowing every nuance of the football field; he has been a defensive coordinator, offensive coordinator, running backs coach, special-teams coach, secondary coach and offensive line coach throughout his career as an assistant.

At New Hampshire in various roles from 1994 to 2006, Kelly had lots of opportunities to leave. He resisted and stayed loyal until Oregon finally called with the offensive coordinator job.

“He did it the right way,” Day said. “He came up in a system, and when his opportunity came at Oregon, he was ready. A lot of people aren’t ready. He was ready. He had the answers and the answers to the answers.”

And for this Oregon team, perhaps the best answer came from one of his motivational ploys in the aftermath of the Boise State game. Kelly joked that, not surprisingly, he got a flood of e-mail messages. A few of the e-mailers brought up the children’s book “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.”

He addressed the team with the story of a boy who told his mother he wanted to move to Australia after having a day much like the night the Ducks had in Boise.

“People in Australia have bad days, too,” Kelly told his team, mimicking the advice of Alexander’s mother.

A copy of the book now sits on a table in Kelly’s office, though there have not been many reasons to read it lately. Oregon edged Purdue and Utah in the games after the loss, and things clicked from there. Oregon blew out California, 42-3, on Sept. 26 and things have gone so smoothly that Oregon rang up 613 yards on U.S.C., the most the Trojans had yielded since 1946.

Quarterback Jeremiah Masoli is playing like an all-American, the red-shirt freshman tailback LaMichael James has emerged as the prototype for Kelly’s offense, and a no-name defense is playing as a cohesive unit.

When asked if he would dwell on the performance against U.S.C., Kelly was quick to respond.

“Not really, to be honest with you,” he said.

In his short time as head coach, Kelly has learned not to overreact. And while he most likely won’t be wearing the mascot head anytime soon — too smelly, he said — Kelly has already revealed himself as one of the country’s top coaches.
