The downward spiral of Binghamton University’s men’s basketball program continued Friday as the university released five more players from the team and the SUNY chancellor said that Binghamton’s president, Lois DeFleur, would have to report to her about the team’s behavior.

Binghamton Coach Kevin Broadus took a team to the N.C.A.A. tournament in March that was filled with high-risk and second-chance recruits. But now the Bearcats, who won the America East conference last season, appear destined for a long year. The university has kicked six players off the team in the last 48 hours, including its three leading scorers, Emanuel Mayben, D. J. Rivera and Malik Alvin. All three had academic or legal trouble before their dismissals.

“Every five years, some program implodes in college basketball,” said Dennis Lasser, a former faculty athletic representative at Binghamton and an associate professor in its school of management. “Why it had to be Binghamton University I’ll never understand.”

Binghamton will have seven eligible scholarship players this season. Not one of those players is a point guard, and only one of them is under 6 feet 5 inches.

The housecleaning began with the dismissal of Mayben, who was arrested Wednesday in Troy, N.Y., on charges of sale and possession of crack cocaine. (The Binghamton Press and Sun-Bulletin reported that Mayben was also arrested with marijuana in his car earlier this month.)

“At what price glory?” asked Tom Brennan, the former Vermont coach. “Not only have they embarrassed themselves and the university, but they’ve embarrassed the America East as well.”

The Binghamton administration had been supportive of Broadus until this week. In June he was given a contract extension through 2014.

But the university’s tenor quickly changed after Mayben’s arrest, which brought a stern warning from Nancy Zimpher, the recently named SUNY chancellor. Zimpher has a reputation for taking a hard line on athletics; she pushed Coach Bob Huggins out the door when she was the president at Cincinnati.

“In light of the most recent incident and other previous incidents related to the men’s basketball team,” Zimpher said in a statement, “I have requested President DeFleur to report on the immediate steps the campus is taking to address these serious issues.”

No reason was given for the five dismissals on Friday, but the move leaves the program in shambles on the court.

Binghamton was criticized when it hired Broadus, who made his name at George Washington and Georgetown by recruiting three players from Lutheran Christian Academy, a Philadelphia school that gained the reputation for being a diploma mill. His hiring seemed a departure for a highly regarded public university.

“What did they gain from it?” Brennan said. “Nothing but bad press. From the minute they got to the N.C.A.A. tournament, they got nothing but bad press.”

Rivera led the team in scoring last season, but he was not named the conference’s player of the year because coaches in the league did not believe he should have been immediately eligible after his transfer from St. Joseph’s, where he sat out a semester because of poor grades.

Alvin, a transfer from Texas-El Paso, was charged with stealing condoms from a Wal-Mart store and assaulting a 66-year-old woman while leaving the store. Broadus suspended Alvin for three games.

The other three players kicked off the team were Corey Chandler, a recent transfer from Rutgers, the junior college transfer Paul Crosby and the walk-on David Fine.

Broadus did not return a call seeking comment but issued a statement that said: “There’s only one captain steering this ship and that’s me. If any of the young men in our program don’t respect the decisions that have been made or the rules we have in place, then they need to move on with their lives.”

With its program gutted, a team that moved up to chase the glory of Division I basketball in 2001 is essentially starting over.

“I’m sad for a lot of people that put a lot of time in the program and had to go through this,” Lasser said. “It’s really a sad day.”
