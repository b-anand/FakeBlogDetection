 The college football season has reached its quarter pole, and the early leaders in the dash to the Bowl Championship Series title game look a lot like the prerace favorites.

Neither No. 1 Florida nor No. 2 Texas appears that it is going to treat the season the way Secretariat did the Belmont, but each has set the pace to win the two slots in the national championship game. And the Gators and the Longhorns can thank the franchise quarterbacks Tim Tebow and Colt McCoy for separating them from a seemingly middling pack.

College football in the B.C.S. era has showed that you don't need a dominant quarterback to win the national title. Tee Martin of Tennessee, Craig Krenzel of Ohio State, Ken Dorsey of Miami and Matt Flynn of Louisiana State are proof of that.

But because of early losses by Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Southern California and Ohio State, the top echelon of college football appears muddled once you get past the Gators and the Longhorns. And, ultimately, Florida and Texas remain the favorites because of Tebow and McCoy.

With three key receivers injured and three other stars battling the flu, Florida rode Tebow to a 23-13 victory against Tennessee on Saturday.

''As long as we have No. 15 there when it's time to go win the game, you're going to run behind the Pouncey twins and you're going to let Tebow go win the game for you,'' Florida Coach Urban Meyer said Sunday, referring to offensive linemen Mike and Maurkice Pouncey.

On a conference call, Meyer considered out loud that the Gators should have played a more wide-open offensive style against the Vols, but later backed off. He said that considering Tennessee's game plan of keeping the game close, as opposed to trying to win it, the Gators did the right thing by being prudent on offense.

''It was unbelievable,'' Meyer said of Tennessee's ambivalent offense. ''They were taking their time snapping the ball when they could go win the game. There was no two-minute drill.''

Texas' 34-24 victory against Texas Tech played out somewhat similarly to the Gators' win. The Longhorns struggled early and, like Florida, will be criticized for beating an unranked conference rival by only 10.

But just as Tebow overcame an interception and a fumble to carry the Gators, McCoy shook off an illness and two interceptions to overcome the Red Raiders. He went 24 of 34 for 205 yards and a 3-yard touchdown pass to seal the game in the fourth quarter.

''I really think it's survival,'' said Texas Coach Mack Brown, who later mentioned the Longhorns' 39-33 loss to Texas Tech last season. ''It's not playoffs, it's not anything else, it is survival. We didn't survive for one half last year and got disappointed.''

Brown added: ''That's just the way college football's gotten. There's not much room for error at the top.''

Though Florida and Texas remain the favorites, the flurry of high-ranked teams falling portends a wild year. Let's not forget that two years ago, L.S.U. lost twice in the regular season before winning the national title.

Here are the remaining teams to keep an eye on:

Penn State

WHY IT HAS A CHANCE Quarterback Daryll Clark is steady, the Nittany Lions host Ohio State, and the defense is among the country's best.

WHY IT DOESN'T Hard to say until it is tested after playing Akron, Syracuse and Temple. The lack of quality receivers will be an issue.

Alabama

WHY IT HAS A CHANCE Any Nick Saban team has a chance, and his defense faces a great test next: Arkansas.

WHY IT DOESN'T Hard to trust the inexperienced quarterback Greg McElroy until he beats more decent teams.

Mississippi

WHY IT HAS A CHANCE Quarterback Jevan Snead could be the No. 1 pick in the N.F.L. draft.
