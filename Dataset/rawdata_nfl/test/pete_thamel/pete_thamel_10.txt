 As the glossy preseason college football periodicals gave way to the first polls this summer, there was not a lot of good news for the Big East conference. The combination of a perceived lack of a marquee team in the league and the Mountain West’s stellar 2008 season led to a drumbeat of criticism.

Columnists called into question the league’s automatic bid to the Bowl Championship Series. A sense of uncertainty, at least in the news media, surrounded the eight-team league.

The Big East had no ranked teams in the preseason polls, and the league’s most recognizable star was Syracuse quarterback Greg Paulus, who built his reputation as a Duke point guard.

“There’s really nothing more irrelevant than preseason rankings,” Nick Carparelli Jr., the Big East’s associate commissioner for football, said Saturday in a telephone interview. “Unfortunately, they’re the rankings that are out there the longest, talked about the most and get the most scrutiny.”

Five weeks into the season, the Big East has silenced nearly all of its critics, thanks mainly to the stellar play of its two undefeated teams: No. 8 Cincinnati (5-0) and No. 23 South Florida (5-0). The Bearcats and the Bulls, who have posted the league’s defining wins, will face off in a Thursday night game on Oct. 15.

The Thursday Big East game has become something of a trademark for the revamped league, which is now in its fifth year in an eight-team format. And because Cincinnati and South Florida have byes this week, they will be undefeated when they meet.

“It’s been our goal to put our best games in a spot where the most people could see it,” Carparelli said. “You can have a great game on a Saturday and it gets lost among a bunch of other great games.”

No one has defended the Big East more vociferously than South Florida Coach Jim Leavitt, who, at the conference’s media day, took umbrage at a reporter who insinuated that the league padded its 12-4 bowl record the last three seasons because of lopsided matchups.

“I’ll say it again, the same thing I told you a month ago, and I’m right,” Leavitt said. “All you can do is look at the bowl games, the nonconference games, and make your own decision.

“I don’t know why the media doesn’t do the things they should do with the Big East. The Big East is that tough.”

Carparelli said the sniping about the league stopped on Labor Day weekend, when Cincinnati, unranked to start the season, went to Rutgers and embarrassed the Scarlet Knights, 47-15. The Bearcats are No. 11 in the nation in total offense. They have two elite players in wide receiver Mardy Gilyard and quarterback Tony Pike.

Gilyard is tied for first in the nation with seven touchdown receptions. He is also averaging 7.6 catches per game for 103.4 yards, both in the top 20 nationally.

Pike is averaging 298.6 passing yards a game. He has 13 touchdown passes, 3 interceptions and a completion percentage of 66.7 percent.

The Bearcats, who have also beaten Oregon State, have had a serviceable defense. They lost 10 starters from last year’s Orange Bowl team and have adapted reasonably well to a new scheme and a slew of position changes.

“They should be in the top 5,” Leavitt said. “They’re that good.”

The Bulls have not proved quite as much as the Bearcats. They won at Florida State, but the value of that victory is debatable, considering the schizophrenic nature of the Seminoles.

It will be hard to get too excited about the Bulls until they hit the meat of conference play. They went 2-5 in the Big East last year and are 3-9 in league road games not played in the Carrier Dome. This year, they have beaten two teams from outside the Football Bowl Subdivision and a weak Western Kentucky team.

U.S.F. also had a pattern of starting strong and fading, most notably in 2007, when it reached as high as No. 2 in the nation and finished unranked.

“We have started off strong and we’ve got to the middle of the season and we hit a slump, a three-game slump or a four-game slump,” the senior safety Nate Allen said. “And to be great, you can’t do that.”

On offense, U.S.F. is not yet polished. The Bulls lost quarterback Matt Grothe, a four-year starter, for the season, but his replacement, B. J. Daniels, has showed promise. Daniels, a freshman, has opened his career with road victories at Florida State and Syracuse. With his huge arm and elusiveness, he promises to be a nightmare for defensive coordinators for years to come. Still, South Florida’s run game is mediocre, and it lost three fumbles against Syracuse on Saturday.

The Bulls’ strength lies in their defensive front four. The star end George Selvie finally has a co-star to take pressure off him in Jason Pierre-Paul, a junior college transfer who has lived up to his five-star billing out of high school. He returned an interception 18 yards for a touchdown at Syracuse on Saturday, one of the seven turnovers the Bulls forced.

The Bulls’ stout defense against Cincinnati’s explosive offense will make for a good Thursday night story line.

“We’ve both got byes this week and we’re going to get to sit and watch teams lose, so this game could end up as a pretty big game,” Selvie said.

With the Chicken Little predictions for the league just a memory, Carparelli could only chuckle at the scale of the denigrating off-season talk about the Big East.

“Nothing causes a greater overreaction than college football,” he said.
