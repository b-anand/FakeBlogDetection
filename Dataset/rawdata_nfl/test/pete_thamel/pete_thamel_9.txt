The low-slung clouds, a bitter October wind and spits of chilly rain portended a change in the seasons here. It was a weekend for the Ole Miss faithful to leave their sundresses in their closets, wear a scarf down to the Square and trade their seersucker jackets for fleeces.

Amid the mist, the big picture of this college football season became a lot clearer. No. 3 Alabama eviscerated No. 20 Ole Miss, 22-3, using a bruising running game, a suffocating defense and opportunistic special teams to make a legitimate claim that it could be the country’s best team.

“This is like climbing a mountain,” Alabama Coach Nick Saban said. “The higher you go, the more treacherous it gets.”

The Crimson Tide and No. 1 Florida — which passed its own test Saturday night by defeating No. 4 Louisiana State, 13-3, in Baton Rouge — appear destined for another date in the Southeastern Conference title game in Atlanta, with Florida the resounding favorite in the SEC East and Alabama looking poised to dominate the West.

Ole Miss reached as high as No. 4 in the rankings, and that appears to be the line of demarcation between the elite teams in college football and the muddled next tier. Florida, Alabama and Texas have been regarded as the three best teams this season, and the drop-off looks steep from there. Alabama did not seem infallible Saturday. But when its offense sputtered in the red zone or quarterback Greg McElroy looked shaky, the Tide’s defense or special teams bailed them out.

Alabama forced five turnovers, including four interceptions of Ole Miss quarterback Jevan Snead. The Crimson Tide pressured Ole Miss relentlessly, leaving Snead ineffective and longing for his old blind-side protector, Michael Oher.

“Their big weakness on their team is their offensive line,” the all-American nose tackle Terrence Cody said. He added, “As we kept hitting him and knocking him down, he was wearing down and started making bad throws.”

The Tide’s specials teams dominated as well, forcing two fumbles, blocking a punt and converting a fake punt with a nifty pass up the middle.

The big question Alabama still has to answer is this: can McElroy lead the offense against the top-tier defenses they will see the rest of the season? The Tide still has to play South Carolina, L.S.U. and Tennessee before that potential matchup against Florida for the conference title.

McElroy looked more like a caretaker than a playmaker Saturday, and he eagerly agreed that his most important statistic of the night was his lack of turnovers. He finished 15 of 34 for 147 yards, but was still smiling. He said he “probably played my worst game of the year up to this point,” but added, “I had zero interceptions and zero fumbles that were lost — you have to be happy about that.”

McElroy often telegraphed his passes to the star receiver Julio Jones by locking too long on him, or forcing passes into double and triple coverage. If Alabama reaches the Bowl Championship Series title game, it will do so because of its offensive line and gritty running game.

The sophomore tailback Mark Ingram finished with 173 yards on 28 carries. His punishing style epitomized Alabama’s ground game, as it often took three or four Mississippi tacklers to bring down the Tide’s ball carriers.

While Alabama churned out yardage, Ole Miss was stuck in neutral.

Snead entered the season as the consensus No. 2 quarterback in the SEC, after Florida’s Tim Tebow, and draft pundits were projecting him as perhaps the N.F.L.’s No. 1 pick in 2010. But Snead has been perhaps the biggest disappointment in college football this season. He entered the game ranked 10th in the SEC in passing efficiency, and Ole Miss Coach Houston Nutt acknowledged that all the preseason expectations might have weighed on him.

Snead’s baffling fall from Heisman candidate to SEC punching bag could be seen in an inept first half. He had as many completions as interceptions — two — and the Rebels had only one first down. It was so bad for Snead at one point that an Ole Miss sports information official hustled over to the statistics keepers during the second quarter to see if an interception could be changed to a fumble. (It was not.)

It was that kind of day for Ole Miss. As dusk settled, and the fans streamed out of the stadium into the biting cold, all the preseason promise here officially blew away.

The season is only halfway done, but the story lines in the SEC are beginning to look a lot like last season’s.
