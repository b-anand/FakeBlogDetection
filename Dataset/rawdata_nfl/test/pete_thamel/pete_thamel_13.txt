The Binghamton University adjunct lecturer who accused the athletic department of giving preferential treatment to men’s basketball players and pressuring her to change her grading policy for players was dismissed Tuesday.

The lecturer, Sally Dear, who taught human development for 11 years, said she felt the decision was linked to her criticism that appeared in a New York Times article in February.

Dear said that the university never investigated her claims and that she hoped the new SUNY chancellor, Nancy Zimpher, who has spoken out recently against the basketball program’s pattern of misbehavior, would pursue the matter.

“I’m being fired for being ethical,” Dear said. “I have no doubt about that whatsoever.”

Gail Glover, a spokeswoman for the university, said Tuesday that Dear’s accusation “is not accurate.”

Dear’s dismissal notice cited the “uncertain fiscal environment” and “strategic reprioritization of resources across the university.” Dear said other adjunct lecturers had been let go, but two faculty members have been added this year. Glover acknowledged that the university was in the midst of unprecedented budget cuts.

Dear’s dismissal comes at a time when Binghamton’s basketball program, which reached the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time last season, has hit a nadir. The university dismissed six players last week, including the starting point guard Emanuel Mayben, who was arrested on charges of selling and possessing of crack cocaine.

Seven Binghamton men’s basketball players majored in human development last year, and Dear said she believed some of them received preferential treatment.

“They know that people have been covering up for the athletes and not holding them to the same standard for other students,” Dear said. “They know that athletes who are not passing classes have been given independent studies to carry them through.”

Glover also denied this accusation.

Dear said other people in her department had been approached by members of the athletic department to change grades for athletes and done so.

“They’re not willing to talk to anyone,” Dear said. “They’re scared of their jobs.”

Dear said she was not “a safe person to have in the department.”

Dennis Lasser, a former athletic representative and tenured associate professor in the Binghamton school of management, said, “I want to have an honest and through investigation of the events surrounding the basketball program.”

Dear said that since she spoke out against the athletic department and the basketball team, she had been “ostracized from her department.” She said her relationship with the human development department chairman, Leo Wilton, soured immediately after the article. She said Wilton, who determines her class schedule, is an avid supporter of the basketball team. (Wilton did not return a telephone call or respond to an e-mail message seeking comment.)

“His attitude to me changed 100 percent as soon as the article came out,” she said. “Night and day.”

And although Dear will be out of work at the end of the semester, she said she had no regrets.

“It’s unfortunate that people who are honest and trying to do their job are punished for that,” she said.
