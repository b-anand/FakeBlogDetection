Joel Thirer resigned as Binghamton University’s athletic director Wednesday, stepping down in the wake of mass dismissals from the basketball team and amid conflict between staff and faculty members and the athletic department.

Lois B. DeFleur, the Binghamton president, outlined further changes in the athletic department, including an external audit, to be sure the university is following American East Conference and N.C.A.A. policies. She also said that Kevin Broadus, the basketball coach, must provide her with a “recruitment and supervision plan for Binghamton’s basketball program.”

“I think it’s a first step in getting us back on track and to what we thought we were going to be when we became a Division I program,” said Dennis Lasser, an associate professor and a faculty athletic representative before his removal after Broadus was hired.

Thirer’s resignation comes as the athletic department deals with numerous problems, including the dismissal of six players last week, most prominently the star point guard Emanuel Mayben after his arrest on charges of sale and possession of crack cocaine.

The athletic department is also dealing with a federal sexual harassment complaint filed by a fund-raiser for the department against two of its employees. They include Jason Siegel, a senior associate athletic director, who was passed over for the interim job. That position was given to another senior associate athletic director, James Norris.

For now, Binghamton appears to be retaining Broadus, whose contract was extended through 2014 after he guided the Bearcats to their first N.C.A.A. tournament berth last season. Broadus, who has about $1 million left on his contract, did not return a phone message Wednesday night.

But the university’s swift action in dismissing six players, Thirer’s resignation and the bleak outlook for the team this season do not appear to bode well for the embattled coach. The team has only seven scholarship players who are eligible and no point guard, and the leading returning scorer averaged less than 5 points a game last season.

Norris, the interim athletic director, said Wednesday night by telephone that he had some “sorting out to do” before he could comment. When asked specifically about Broadus’s future, he declined comment.

“Don’t read into that one way or another,” Norris said.

There is also the lingering issue of accusations against the athletic department made by Sally Dear, an adjunct lecturer, who said in an interview in February that she was pressured by the athletic department to change basketball players’ grades. The university dismissed her Tuesday, citing the “uncertain fiscal environment” and “strategic reprioritization of resources across the university.”

Dear said this week that colleagues had told her they had changed grades for athletes.

Nancy L. Zimpher, the chancellor of the State University of New York system, which includes Binghamton, said Dear’s February accusations had been investigated.

“Earlier this year, concerns were raised that academic integrity may have been impacted at Binghamton as a result of activity in the athletic department,” Zimpher said. “A careful review was conducted at that time at Binghamton, and I have been assured by President DeFleur that this was not the case.”

Dear said no one spoke with her during the investigation. “How can they conduct an investigation if one of the principal people involved has not been talked to?” she said.

Thirer, who did not return a phone call Wednesday night, is being reassigned to the office of the provost to work on projects related to undergraduate transfers.

He had been athletic director since 1989 and oversaw the transition of Binghamton’s athletics from Division III to Division I in 2001. He hired Broadus in March 2007.

When Thirer learned from a reporter that Broadus had previously recruited from a Philadelphia high school that gained the reputation for being a diploma mill, he promised nothing similar would take place at Binghamton.

“Binghamton has never engaged in that type of behavior,” he said. “If there’s a history of that, it certainly won’t be the case here. I can guarantee that. We just don’t want to win that badly.”

Since Broadus came, there have been three arrests of players, including Mayben’s, and the recruiting of several transfer players who had academic or legal problems. Miladin Kovacevic, whom Broadus did not recruit, was accused of beating a student into a coma and fled to his native Serbia. Malik Alvin, whom Broadus brought in, was charged with stealing condoms.

As problems mounted, Thirer insisted that the university was not sacrificing its integrity to win. He did not address the recent problems in a statement Wednesday.

“My commitment to the ideals of Binghamton University and to the intercollegiate program remains steadfast,” he said.
