For years, college football’s commissioners and presidents have clung to their standard line about why the sport would not institute a postseason playoff model.

Jordan Shipley helped Texas rout Central Florida. The Longhorns' nonconference schedule seems to lack competitive games.

Alabama's Julio Jones after a 73-yard touchdown reception in a win over L.S.U. The Crimson Tide, Texas and Florida all have a title shot.

Those who oversee the Bowl Championship Series are so concerned by the thought of a playoff that at the B.C.S. meetings in Florida two years ago, they voted not to even discuss the issue.

Instead, they have continuously offered the idea that “every week is a playoff” and that college presidents are spooked by the notion of the sport becoming too commercial and, gulp, too professional.

But with a pedestrian Heisman Trophy field, no elite team that scintillates the masses and virtually no chance of a team outside the Big Three crashing the national title game, this college football season is sputtering to the finish.

As the regular season pushes toward its final three weeks, there does not appear to be a single competitive game left on the schedule that directly relates to the national title.

It is a three-horse race, with Texas, Florida and Alabama all running against claimers.

So instead of marquee matchups, the next three weeks will be much more like the last two. The biggest stories will be about questionable calls by officials on the field, and in the replay booth, and coaches being slapped on the wrist or fined for voicing their feelings about the officiating.

Sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Has the highlight of the week in college football come down to Lane Kiffin’s latest quip? Or whether Southeastern Conference Commissioner Mike Slive will fine coaches for pointing out rather obvious missed calls by officials?

If these story lines sound familiar — fines, officiating concerns and quotes from unhappy coaches — it would be because they are a lot of the same issues the N.F.L. faces. The biggest difference, however, is that at the end of the N.F.L. season, the top teams are usually left to play each other, returning the focus to the field.

This week, we can talk about whether Louisiana State defensive back Patrick Peterson needed to have three feet inbounds, instead of the two he appeared to have, in order for his interception against Alabama to count. Or whether L.S.U. Coach Les Miles will be fined for his comments about the bad call.

Forget the story lines about the plight of the outsider teams like Texas Christian and Boise State, fine squads that are fighting a system that works against them. It is all just white noise.

There is little that any public relations team can do to change Boise’s reality — it will never play for the national title under this B.C.S. system. Neither will T.C.U.

(A B.C.S. official has asked that teams outside the power six conferences be referred to as nonautomatic qualifiers and not non-B.C.S. teams. Hard to do when a non-B.C.S. team has yet to make the national title game.)

Instead, we are left to focus on the next big date on the schedule, which is Dec. 5, when Florida will play Alabama in the SEC championship, a game that should, yet again, produce this year’s national champion. In the meantime, sit back and enjoy Florida eviscerating Florida International, gather around the television to watch Alabama roll past Chattanooga. And when Texas makes it to the national title game, savor the chance to see the Longhorns play a fairly matched opponent. So far, that has not happened.

The Longhorns’ nonconference schedule — Louisiana-Monroe, Texas-El Paso, Central Florida and Wyoming — is a window into the state of college football, where big-money universities apparently do not feel the need to line up competitive games. But remember, every week is a playoff, competitive scheduling or not. (And while Texas had more competitive teams back out of their schedule this season, the Longhorns’ cachet along with ESPN’s help in creating more attractive matchups seemingly could make scheduling magic happen.)

That leaves three weeks before a competitive game that has an effect on the season. So we will watch to see if Arizona makes its first Rose Bowl, if the Charlie Weis era ends in South Bend and if Houston’s Case Keenum can keep impersonating Andre Ware.

But the race for the national title game has officially become a bore. The undefeated non-B.C.S. teams are irrelevant in the title race because of the current system and Cincinnati (9-0 and ranked fifth in the B.C.S. standings) can only twiddle its thumbs and hope for the teams ahead of it to stumble, much the way the top teams did in 2007.

It is too bad that in this great era of parity that so many teams do not have the opportunity to prove themselves.

Instead, the story lines will be bad games, the limited access for non-B.C.S. teams and how Slive handles future coaching-officiating conflicts.

Amateurism at its finest.
