 An opera singer from Wales sang ''God Save The Queen'' before kickoff. There were fireworks, giant flames and even a canned pop-music act, enough shenanigans to appeal to the masses and give the N.F.L.'s annual cameo appearance in Europe a Super Bowl feel.

But once the game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the New England Patriots kicked off Sunday, all the novelty of American football in Europe could not obscure reality. New England routed Tampa Bay, 35-7, before 84,254 fans at sold-out Wembley Stadium, showing that the Buccaneers' ineptitude transcends continents.

As the N.F.L. season heads toward its halfway point, the Patriots (5-2) and Tom Brady seem to have found their footing after an uneven start, with back-to-back blowout victories over two hapless teams.

New England took control when Brandon Meriweather returned an interception 39 yards for a touchdown less than three minutes into the game.

Brady was not as masterly as he was in a 59-0 victory over Tennessee the previous week, when he set an N.F.L. record by throwing for five touchdowns in the second quarter. Against Tampa Bay (0-7), he completed 23 of 32 passes, threw for three touchdowns and tossed two interceptions, including one that Tanard Jackson snared in the end zone.

But since missing nearly the entire 2008 season and looking out of sync at times early this season, Brady appears to have found a groove. Working with Randy Moss, Wes Welker and a nearly anonymous supporting cast of receivers, Brady sprayed the ball around the field with typical aplomb against the overmatched Tampa Bay defense.

Brady finished the game with 308 yards passing and connected on touchdown passes to Welker (14 yards), Sam Aiken (54) and Ben Watson (35). Welker finished with 10 catches for 107 yards.

''I'm feeling great,'' said Brady, who joked with Welker about a big night out in London before the team flight home Monday morning. He later said, ''It will never happen again for us, so we'll retire 1-0 internationally.''

The big question heading into this game was not who would win it, but how it would resonate with British fans.

The N.F.L. has played here three seasons in a row, and the Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, said Friday that he would like to see an N.F.L. franchise here in the next decade. Kraft said after the game that he saw nothing to change that position.

''It was a great experience,'' he said. ''It really was. I'm happy that we did it. I didn't see anything today to change my mind. It was only positive reinforcement.''

One of the most intriguing aspects of this game might have been how it was covered by the local news media. Televisions in the press rooms before the game featured the day's biggest sporting event in England, the Premier League soccer match between Manchester United and Liverpool. (Liverpool won, 2-0, making it a bad day for the Glazer family, which owns both Manchester United and the Buccaneers.)

The local broadcast on Sky Sports featured interviews with two Tampa Bay Buccaneers cheerleaders; the Welsh opera singer, Katherine Jenkins; and a television host named Vernon Kay, who is a bit like an English version of Ryan Seacrest.

The N.F.L. is still finding its footing here. Welker said he and Brady were mistaken for a boy band.

For all the cross-cultural hoopla, this game will just be a speck in the mosaic of the N.F.L. season. The Patriots are entering a bye week, then have a treacherous stretch: Miami, at Indianapolis, the Jets and at New Orleans. That will show just how far Brady has come.

The Patriots will head into those games with surging confidence. Their London trip will be remembered, as they say in these parts, as a lovely holiday.
