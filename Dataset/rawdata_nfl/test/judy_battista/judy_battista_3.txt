 Tom Brady looked a little weary and in need of a shave after the New England Patriots beat the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. Maybe he was just tired of everyone wondering if he was back to normal eight games into the season. It's time to answer that question honestly.

Is Brady ever going to look the way he did in 2007? Maybe not, considering that even the Patriots did not resemble their own fabled juggernaut by the end of that season and they no longer have Donte' Stallworth and Jabar Gaffney, who combined for more than 1,000 receiving yards that season. With Wes Welker and Randy Moss, the Patriots had one of the best receiving foursomes in N.F.L. history.

But does Brady look great for a player who missed essentially an entire season with a devastating knee injury? Considering that in his last three games, he has thrown for 1,020 yards (in three consecutive 300-yard games), 10 touchdowns and 3 interceptions, yes. Let it go.

''We've analyzed every drop-back and throw and his inner feelings,'' said Phil Simms, CBS's lead analyst and a former Giants quarterback. ''Everybody predicted he'd come out and be on fire. We've seen just about every single quarterback that misses a little time in preseason struggle. So what do we expect of a quarterback who missed a whole year? To say it was a struggle is overstating it.''

Peyton Manning had his own creaky comeback from off-season knee surgery last year, and although Manning has never missed a start, he could not immediately bounce back from an injury far less severe than Brady's. Perhaps the friends can compare scars Sunday night when their teams face off in their annual grudge match.

It's no accident the game is this week: the N.F.L. schedules it each year to coincide with the end of the baseball season and the start of the second half of the football season. It has often determined home-field advantage in the American Football Conference playoffs.

Last year, the two knee injuries took some of the luster off the game because both teams were struggling for survival, rather than playoff seeding. Not so this season. The Colts are 8-0, one of two unbeaten teams remaining, and the Patriots (6-2) are two games up in the A.F.C. East.

This game could produce an epic shootout because the Colts have a virtually nonexistent running offense. That's why, as much as any other game, this will be the ultimate test of Brady's health. Because of injuries, the Colts are starting two rookie cornerbacks, and safety Bob Sanders, one of the league's best defensive players, is out for the season with a biceps injury. Before his injury, Brady would have been expected to pick this defense apart.Houston quarterback Matt Schaub completed 32 of 43 passes for 311 yards, a touchdown and 2 interceptions against it Sunday in the Texans' 20-17 loss. In the Patriots' 27-17 victory Sunday, the Dolphins matched a rookie cornerback on Moss, and Vontae Davis did an admirable job, outjumping him for an early interception. But Moss's 71-yard catch-and-run touchdown was a thing of beauty. Welker ran a crossing pattern, drawing the safety to him. That left Moss, crossing the other way, in single coverage with Davis. Catch, stiff-arm, face plant, touchdown.

Until the injuries set in, the Colts had been playing a far more aggressive defense with more blitzing than under their former coach Tony Dungy. That would be the perfect formula to combat Brady, who, despite his statistics, has had only one pinpoint perfect game this season: against the Titans, when he threw six touchdown passes. But an inexperienced secondary leaves the Colts vulnerable now. Barring a collapse, both teams are going to the playoffs, almost certainly as division champions. The jockeying for January is under way.
