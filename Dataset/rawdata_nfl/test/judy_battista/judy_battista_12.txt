 Can it really be less than three weeks since the Baltimore Ravens appeared to have a realistic chance to beat the New England Patriots and assume supremacy in the American Football Conference? That game, it turns out, may still be a signal moment for the Ravens franchise, for all the wrong reasons.

It's going to be a long and unpleasant bye week in Baltimore, coming as it does after three consecutive losses, the first to the Patriots and the most recent to the Vikings on Sunday. In better times, with better results, the story might be that Joe Flacco is leading an offense that sometimes looks as explosive as Tom Brady's in New England. It might be that with Cam Cameron, the team's offensive coordinator, taking off the restraints, Flacco is emerging as one of the game's best quarterbacks, after engineering a 21-point fourth quarter Sunday despite taking a continual pounding.

But these are not good times for the Ravens, and it feels as if a permanent shift is under way, toward a team whose defensive dynasty is fading and will need lots of Flacco heroics to bail it out. The Ravens are reeling, having fallen a game behind the Bengals and the Steelers in the A.F.C. North.

The Ravens missed a 44-yard field-goal attempt that would have beaten the Vikings on Sunday. But they needed it because the defense had given back a late lead on the Vikings' final drive, which included a 58-yard strike from Brett Favre to Sidney Rice that scorched cornerback Frank Walker so badly he desperately grabbed for Rice's jersey, incurring an interference penalty that was declined.

''Their corner, or lack thereof, is causing a serious adjustment to what they can do,'' the former Ravens coach Brian Billick wrote in an e-mail message on Monday.

That's an understatement. The cornerbacks, Domonique Foxworth, who was signed in the off-season for $16.5 million guaranteed, and Fabian Washington, are small at 5 feet 11 inches. Foxworth, in particular, is struggling with a lack of physical play in coverage.

The defensive front is still superb in the red zone. The Ravens stopped three Vikings drives inside the 20-yard line (a fourth was stopped just outside the 20) to force field goals. But the secondary has been shredded. The Chargers passed for 436 yards. The Chiefs scored 24 points. Favre's completion rate was 72 percent, a window into the bigger problem. The team that once was able to win without the benefit of a reliable offense now has no reliable defense.

It has allowed 130 points, which was above the league average of 117.6 through Sunday, and 332.7 yards per game. The great defense of the 2000 team allowed 165 points. It had Chris McAlister and Duane Starks, though, so the comparison should end there. But even last year's defense allowed only 244 points, third in the league. The Ravens' defense is giving up 5.68 yards on first down, which ranked 22nd in the league. This is how far the defense has fallen: the Washington Redskins, who are on the verge of complete chaos after losing to the Chiefs, have allowed just 96 points. It all adds up to a defense that was ranked 17th over all -- 17th! the Ravens! -- and 22nd against the pass.

The problem is only exacerbated by the quick-strike offense, which can put up oodles of points but also puts the defense on the field more often. Through six games, four Ravens opponents have run more than 63 plays. Last season only one team ran 60 in the first six games.
