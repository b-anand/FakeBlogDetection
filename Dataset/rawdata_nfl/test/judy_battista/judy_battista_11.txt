 Even by the standards of the Oakland Raiders, the accusation that Coach Tom Cable had broken the jaw of an assistant coach during training camp was bizarre. On Thursday, the Napa County district attorney announced that after a two-month investigation, Cable would not be charged.

Cable is not completely in the clear. The N.F.L. announced Thursday night that it would review the district attorney's decision and the surrounding investigation and then decide if Cable would face discipline under the league's personal conduct policy. Commissioner Roger Goodell has taken a hard line against players who have violated the policy, and last week Goodell left open the possibility of disciplining Cable even if he was not charged.

The assistant, Randy Hanson, had claimed that during a meeting of coaches Cable threw him from a chair, sending him falling into a piece of furniture, while Cable screamed, ''I'll kill you,'' according to an account that Hanson gave to Yahoo Sports. Hanson eventually went to an emergency room, and staffers there alerted the police. Cable has denied assaulting Hanson.

In an afternoon news conference, Napa County District Attorney Gary Lieberstein said there were inconsistencies in Hanson's statements, and he noted that Hanson was slow to cooperate with the authorities, giving more details to Yahoo Sports than he did to the police. Lieberstein said the evidence indicated that ''there were no blows or punches thrown at or near Randy Hanson, nor were any verbal threats made by Tom Cable toward Mr. Hanson.''

Lieberstein offered a version of events markedly different from Hanson's. Lieberstein said during a talk among coaches about Hanson's future, Cable got angry and rushed toward Hanson.

''At that juncture, one of the other coaches in the room stepped in between the two and Mr. Cable bumped into him, which in turn caused that coach to bump into Mr. Hanson's chair in which he was leaning back, with his feet upon the table,'' Lieberstein said.

As a result, Hanson fell over and Lieberstein said that was probably when he broke his jaw. Lieberstein said that witnesses to the incident said that Cable grabbed Hanson by the shirt when he was on the ground.

Hanson remains on the team payroll but is not involved in coaching. He was retained in January by Al Davis, the Raiders' owner, before Cable was named the head coach.

Cable, in his regularly scheduled meeting with reporters held before the district attorney's announcement, had no comment on the case. The Raiders play the Jets on Sunday, and the news was not all good for Raiders fans. The game will be blacked out in Oakland.
