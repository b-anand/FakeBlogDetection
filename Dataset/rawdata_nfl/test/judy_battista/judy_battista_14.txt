Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning took such a hard hit to his left knee last week that it required medical attention after the game, even though Manning was wearing a brace when the contact occurred. New England’s Tom Brady was hit near his right knee two weeks ago with a glancing blow that did not even knock him off his feet, leaving him upright to turn and wave for a flag from the official nearby.

The Ravens’ Terrell Suggs, forcing Tom Brady to fumble Oct. 4, was later given a questionable roughing-the-passer penalty.

The Ravens’ Ray Lewis, left, was penalized for his hit on the Bengals’ Chad Ochocinco on Oct. 11. Lewis was fined $25,000 by the N.F.L. He plans to appeal.

Both hits drew roughing-the-passer penalties and illustrated how wide the range of unacceptable hits has become as the N.F.L. struggles to offer more protection to players they consider vulnerable to injury, especially quarterbacks. From the moment Brady spun around and encouraged the referee Ron Winter to throw his flag, there has been a debate about whether the N.F.L. — with its emphasis on penalties for roughing the passer and unnecessary roughness — has gone too far to shield players, especially the marquee ones, from harm in a fundamentally brutal sport.

“They’re trying to legislate hitting out of the game,” said the former quarterback Trent Dilfer, who as an ESPN analyst has taken issue with how heavily the people who play his old position are protected. “It’s affecting the outcome of games. The name on the back of the jersey has become more important than the team.”

The N.F.L. makes no secret of its desire to protect quarterbacks, who are usually a franchise’s most important player and the one who fills seats. Through the fourth week of play, the most recent numbers available, roughing-the-passer penalties had increased only slightly, to 21 in 2009 from 18 in 2008, according to the league. But unnecessary-roughness infractions — like the helmet-propelling hit Ray Lewis put on Chad Ochocinco last Sunday — have soared, to 64 from 51, reflecting a crackdown on everything from the wedge to chop blocks to blindside blocks on a defensive player’s head. In Week 5, only 2 of the 13 games were played without either a roughing-the-passer or unnecessary-roughness penalty.

Since 1990, as the pass has become more prevalent, roughing-the-passer penalties have risen. In 1990, roughing the passer was called 35 times. That grew to a high of 135 times in 2004. The number has declined steadily since then, when it hit 60 in 2008 — a likely reflection of defenders’ ability to adjust how they play to conform with the rules. But if the current pace holds up, the N.F.L. would have about 80 roughing-the-passer penalties this season, a third more than last season’s number.

The N.F.L. says it is not surprised by the spike because it was a point of emphasis when officials convened before the season for their annual clinic, where they are shown in video form how the league wants the game officiated.

“We’re not going to let up in trying to protect the players,” Mike Pereira, the N.F.L.’s vice president for officiating, said. “The clear message is being sent — we’re going to protect the head and we’re going to protect the knees and we’re going to do that on those most vulnerable.”

Pereira often hears complaints that big penalties should not be called late in games, lest they affect the results the way Lewis’s hit on Ochocinco helped the Bengals on their winning drive last week. That, Pereira said, is not realistic or fair.

“That’s like telling a team, ‘We’re in the last minute, so take advantage,’ ” he said. “Not going to happen.”

And although the low hit on Brady by Baltimore’s Terrell Suggs might have been a questionable violation of the rule that is interpreted as prohibiting hitting low in the leg with force — the so-called Tom Brady rule, after Brady’s knee injury last year — Pereira said it was appropriate for big-picture reasons.

“The last thing I want to do is lay off those calls, because then you’re sending a message that it is O.K. to go low on the quarterback,” Pereira said. “That’s not a message we want sent.”

The message may need some honing. The Ravens were enraged by the penalty on Suggs, who after the game summed up what many defenders were thinking. “Maybe next year, it’ll be two-hand touch to get a sack,” he said.

The Giants owner John Mara, a member of the competition committee, said: “I have seen some calls this year that I haven’t been pleased with. But as painful as it is if you’re that club, in terms of the effect on player health, if it keeps a quarterback from getting hurt or a defenseless receiver from getting hurt, I think it’s worth the trouble.”

Tony Dungy, a former coach and current NBC analyst, says he agrees with the intent of the rules, if not the execution in enforcing them. Dungy said defenders were flummoxed because the rules’ language was ambiguous and the calls were inconsistent from game to game.

“You know as a defensive player if I hit in the head, it’s a penalty,” Dungy said. “But then when you say you can’t go low with force, what is forcible? Terrell Suggs was not forcible contact. You’re better off saying you can’t contact below the thigh. Defenders are saying, ‘I’m trying to get a sack and I didn’t think I used great force,’ but how do you know? What frustrates defensive players is ambiguity. It’s like hitters in baseball; you just want to know where the strike zone is.”

The greater problem, Dilfer said, is that defensive players — he was one until he was switched to quarterback — are taught to bury their helmet in their target and then explode upward from their hips to complete the tackle. If they are told to hit from midthigh to the armpit, it makes the strike zone almost impossibly small, especially if the quarterback is moving and the defender is being blocked.

Dilfer offered two solutions. First, make sure quarterbacks are taught not to lock their knee when they plant their foot, which could reduce the damage caused by a low hit. And he said the rules should bore more deeply into the offender’s intent. A late hit would draw a penalty, but he says it is easy to decipher when a defender intends to hurt a player.

“I think if there is clear intent to hurt or it was late, throw the flag,” Dilfer said. “Otherwise, these guys wear pads. If they’re only looking for two things, that makes it easier.”

That kind of change seems unlikely, which means there will be more fuel for debate each week. Perhaps among the players, too.

“At the end of the day, players want to be protected,” said Ray Anderson, the N.F.L.’s executive vice president for football operations and a former agent. “It may not be macho or manly to admit you want protection. I know from talking to coaches and players, they like the emphasis, particularly on unnecessary roughness, the stuff that could ruin careers. It’s not their culture to say anything. But we’re responsible for helping to protect players from each other.”
