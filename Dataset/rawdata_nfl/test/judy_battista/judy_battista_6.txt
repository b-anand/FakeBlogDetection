 In the days leading to Favreageddon, Troy Aikman, the Hall of Fame quarterback who analyzed the Vikings-Packers game for Fox television, predicted that Favre would be highly emotional in his return to Lambeau Field, but would feel right at home once play began.

''I would think because of all the success he's enjoyed there, there will be a real level of comfort for him,'' Aikman said.

Aikman was right. Favre choked up in a postgame interview after Minnesota's 38-26 victory Sunday, but the real measure of his greatness was that he did not choke at all during the game.

This was the measured Favre, harnessing his emotions and using his weapons, that the Vikings had hoped for when they coaxed him out of retirement. It was not the wild-throwing Favre whom Green Bay General Manager Ted Thompson sent packing after the 2007 season.

Perhaps plenty of Packers faithful are again questioning that decision, with the fresh reminder of Favre's slipping and sliding away from the Green Bay defense, a 40-year-old playing like the 25-year-old they adored. He threw four touchdown passes (the 21st time he has done it, tying him with Dan Marino for the most in an N.F.L. career), was not sacked, was pressured only four times, and he did not throw an interception.

''It's magical,'' the former quarterback Trent Dilfer, an analyst for ESPN, said Monday morning. ''Bad Brett Favre in the past always looked like he felt he had to do it on his own and let his emotions get the best of him. Good Brett Favre this year seems very comfortable and is not trying to do too much. And in not doing too much, he's doing a lot.''

If the game proved anything, it was that although Thompson might have made the right call at quarterback, he did not anywhere else. Green Bay was unable to stop the Vikings' electrifying rookie Percy Harvin (261 total yards) and again had no answer for Minnesota's pass rush (six sacks).

Harvin's play and the Vikings' defense are two reasons Minnesota is 7-1 and, along with the New Orleans Saints, the class of the National Football Conference at the halfway mark, while the Packers are 4-3. Being the top team halfway through the season means little -- ask the Tennessee Titans or the Giants about last season. But in the Vikings' two victories over the Packers this season, Favre completed 41 of 59 passes for 515 yards, 7 touchdowns and no interceptions. He has not been sacked; the Vikings sacked Favre's heir, Aaron Rodgers, 14 times.

That was partly Rodgers's fault. He holds the ball too long. But it is mostly the fault of a miserable offensive line that has turned Rodgers, the top-rated quarterback in the league, into a punching bag. It did not give Rodgers enough time to complete plays downfield even with the Vikings' premier defensive back, Antoine Winfield, out with an injury. When Rodgers seemed to dump off short passes more quickly in the second half, the Packers rallied.

The Packers could not hold off the Vikings, though, and defensive end Cullen Jenkins said that players felt handcuffed by Dom Capers's defense, according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The switch in the off-season to the 3-4 from the 4-3 has put numerous players, including Jenkins and Aaron Kampman, into new positions that have stymied their productivity.

''Are we doing everything we can to win games, or are we doing everything we can to run a certain thing that we want to run?'' Jenkins said. ''I want to win, and I want to do whatever it takes to win. At some point, you have to take the handcuffs off and let the boys play.''

It was one last throwback Favre moment: leaving opposing players turning on one another in frustration as they left Lambeau Field.

More Revival Acts

Brett Favre, of course, never had to face the ignominy of losing his starting job, but perhaps Alex Smith and Vince Young can learn something from him, anyway: there may be life after somebody tells you your career is over.
