The Kansas City Chiefs released running back Larry Johnson on Monday morning, just as his two-week suspension for conduct detrimental to the team ended.

The Chiefs were furious with Johnson for a series of actions, including mocking Coach Todd Haley’s lack of football playing experience on his Twitter account; using a gay slur on Twitter and again in the locker room when addressing a group of reporters; and, in the incident that most angered General Manager Scott Pioli, belittling a fan on Twitter by saying he made more money.

The decision to release Johnson was surprising because the Chiefs had agreed to a deal with Johnson’s agent in which Johnson would lose just one paycheck, about $300,000, during the suspension.

The Chiefs were reluctant to cut Johnson outright two weeks ago, fearing that it would send a signal that a player could misbehave and complain his way out of town. The Chiefs were unimpressed by an apology Johnson issued, which pointedly did not apologize to gays.

The Chiefs seem committed never to allow Johnson to play for them again. They could have deactivated Johnson for each game for the rest of the season, but they undoubtedly did not want the considerable distraction and locker room poison Johnson might have been if he were around the team each week while it struggled to rebuild.

Johnson, a No. 1 pick out of Penn State in 2003, was one of the N.F.L.’s top rushers in 2005 and 2006. But his career was also pockmarked by repeated off-the-field trouble, and he was known as a moody locker-room presence. Last season, the coach at the time, Herman Edwards, deactivated him for three games and the league suspended him for a fourth after a string of incidents with women at Kansas City nightspots. One woman accused him of throwing a drink at her, and another said he pushed her head. Johnson apologized for those incidents, too.

Perhaps most critically, Johnson’s production had tailed off. He had 132 carries this season for 358 yards, an average of 2.7 yards a carry.

Since his suspension by the Chiefs, a grass-roots fan effort took hold in the form of an online petition calling for the Chiefs to prevent Johnson from breaking Priest Holmes’s team career rushing record. The Kansas City Star reported Monday that the petition had collected more than 32,000 signatures. Johnson falls 74 yards short of the record.

Johnson is almost certain to clear waivers, because a team that claims him would have to pay his salary of more than $2 million, which the Chiefs will pay if he is not picked up. But if he clears waivers and a team signs him, Johnson will still collect his salary from the Chiefs.

Among those teams that may be interested in signing Johnson are the Washington Redskins, whose running back Clinton Portis sustained a concussion Sunday. Coach Jim Zorn acknowledged Monday that the Redskins would discuss Johnson.

“A part of him is excited and a part of him is very regretful,” Johnson’s agent, Peter Schaffer, told The Associated Press. “There’s a lot of feelings going on right now. It’s analogous to breaking up with a girlfriend. Maybe you saw it coming, but it still hurts when it happens.”
