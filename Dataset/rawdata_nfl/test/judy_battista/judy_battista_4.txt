A year ago, the Miami Dolphins unveiled the Wildcat against New England, sending the confused Patriots reeling. Coach Bill Belichick, bemoaning how often the Dolphins had given the Patriots trouble in the past, predicted last week that the Patriots would see more offensive wrinkles from the Dolphins when the teams met Sunday.

And when the Dolphins showcased a spread option that must have made the rookie quarterback Pat White feel as if he were back at West Virginia, it sent shivers down the backs of future Dolphins opponents and even set the Patriots back for a few minutes.

But those who call the Wildcat a gimmick point to teams like the Patriots as an example of why it will not last: if a team has a great quarterback, no coach will take the ball from his hands. Sure enough, Tom Brady highlighted that point with one classic pass to Randy Moss — who sprang a 71-yard touchdown with a stiff arm that sent a Dolphins defender falling on his face — and the Patriots secured a 27-17 victory with a fourth-quarter defensive stand.

The touchdown pass came moments after the Dolphins had chewed up 10 minutes on a third-quarter scoring drive that gave them an achingly brief lead. That lopsidedness has become a hallmark of the Dolphins this season. They held the ball for all but 15 minutes against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 2 and still lost.

“That third quarter had elements of Indianapolis-Miami, when Miami held the ball a long time and Indy scored on big plays,” Belichick said. “Those plays turn around in a hurry.”

The Dolphins, with the spread and the Wildcat, will limp back to Florida, perhaps bedeviling opponents with their gadgetry but fading from the playoff race at 3-5. The Patriots may never again roll over teams the way they did in 2007, but they have returned to an earlier championship-filled incarnation: a team with a quickly adjusting defense that finds a way to grind out victories. They are 6-2 and in control of the American Football Conference East with a two-game lead over the idle Jets as they head to Indianapolis for their annual showdown against the Colts.

The Patriots spend up to 30 percent of their practice time on the Wildcat, and Belichick said they were prepared for the option, too. The Dolphins waited until the second quarter to use the Wildcat this year, but when White first took the field at quarterback, then kept the ball on an option run for 33 yards, the Patriots briefly looked as flummoxed as they were last year, when Miami scored four times from the Wildcat in a 38-13 win in Week 3. White ran again for 4 yards and three plays later completed the drive by pitching to Ricky Williams for a 15-yard touchdown run. After that, Belichick spoke with his defense on the sideline — Williams said the Patriots moved a linebacker up near the line of scrimmage — and the option did not work as well after that.

“The first couple of times they ran it, we were indecisive,” Belichick said. “After we saw it, we were a lot more confident and had everybody accounted for. Once we saw it, we played more aggressively.”

The Patriots had a decided statistical advantage, with 432 yards of offense — Brady spent the day in the shotgun and rarely felt pressure — compared with 334 yards for the Dolphins. But they struggled to keep drives going, successful on only 6 of 13 third-down plays, and that allowed the Dolphins several opportunities to tie the score in the fourth quarter.

With 3 minutes 38 seconds left, the Dolphins started a drive on their 14. But after a completion pushed the Dolphins to their 32, the drive fell apart. The worst play came on third-and-10 when, with the Patriots showing an all-out blitz, Dolphins quarterback Chad Henne called a timeout. But the Dolphins had none remaining. The delay of game pushed the Dolphins back 5 yards; two plays later, Ted Ginn Jr. — who buried the Jets last week with two kickoff returns for touchdowns — let a pass on first down slip through his hands.

“We have wanted to take them down to a place they haven’t been, that’s a tight ballgame in the fourth quarter,” Henne said. “It came down to that, we just fell short. Definitely there was some confidence there, that we can play with them and some other teams in the league.”

That, of course, is not the measuring stick of success the Patriots use, and it is not the one the Dolphins want, either.

“That’s the last thing I want to hear — close in this game just don’t get it,” Dolphins Coach Tony Sparano said. “That’s why these guys have a lot of banners out here now. They figure out how to win these close games.”
