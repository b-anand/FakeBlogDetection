 Brett Favre looked glassy-eyed Sunday night after he took one last hard hit from the Pittsburgh Steelers, but the Minnesota Vikings' first loss of the season will take only a little shine off the return of the prodigal Favre in Green Bay next week.

Favre will protest that these games do not really mean much to him, but consider this: when the Vikings hosted the Packers a few weeks ago, Favre broke from his routine of going on the field early to throw the ball around and chat up his buddies from the other team. Favre is such a world-class schmoozer that when Steve Mariucci took the San Francisco 49ers into Lambeau Field to play the Packers years ago, Favre stopped throwing his warm-up passes, walked over to Mariucci and 49ers quarterback Steve Young, and said, ''Let's take a picture,'' Mariucci recalled, adding: ''So the three of us took pictures.''

Don't expect the class reunion routine Sunday. Mariucci, who remains close to Favre, says he expects Favre to warm up indoors instead, shielding himself from the weirdness of the situation. Joe Montana took Kansas City into the playoffs after he left the 49ers, but at least the two teams were not hated division rivals.

There has been nothing to compare to Favre's flight from Green Bay to the Vikings, with a stopover in New York, especially now that the Packers (4-2) and the Vikings (6-1) are in a genuine race for the National Football Conference North title, with the Packers just a game and a half behind. After all, nobody can remember a fan wearing a Montana jersey with the name Judas on it, as a Packers fan did with the No. 4 shirt he wore weeks ago at Lambeau.

''I'm glad the first game with them is over,'' Favre said Sunday night about playing the Packers. ''My career with Green Bay speaks for itself. That won't change. For three hours, I'll be on the other side. Do I know what that will feel like? I have no idea.''

Maybe a little like that hit James Harrison put on him on the final play of the Steelers game. Favre has insisted he is not motivated by revenge against the Packers and General Manager Ted Thompson, but Mariucci suspects otherwise.

''I think that's human nature,'' he said. ''Anybody that's been turned away might want to prove himself to either that club or to the fans, or to himself.''

So far, Favre has proved only that he was right about wanting to go to the Vikings. His comfort level in the offense, which is virtually identical to the one he ran in Green Bay, is obvious, as if he has slipped into a familiar pair of the blue jeans he endorses.

Against the Baltimore Ravens, Favre fired a bullet to receiver Sidney Rice, and he had the look of the 25-year-old Favre. On Sunday, he rhapsodized about the rookie receiver Percy Harvin, saying how simpatico they are within the offense, the kind of relationship Favre enjoyed for years with Antonio Freeman. Favre never had that kind of ease with the Jets, in part because it is difficult for a quarterback and a receiver to be on the same page when the quarterback is not even sure which page he is on. With the Vikings, Favre has thrown 12 touchdown passes and only 3 interceptions, and he is completing 68.9 percent of his passes. For all the early hosannas thrown his way in the first half of his Jets season, it does not take much film study to see the difference.

Favre even told Mariucci that there were times last season when, on third-and-6 for instance, the Jets' offensive coordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, would ask Favre what he wanted to run. And Favre would be thinking, Just call the play; I just learned this offense, Mariucci said.

Still, there were a few moments Sunday when Favre looked as if he was channeling his lone Jets season, raising the question of whether another late-season tailspin is coming up as rapidly as the gray hair in his beard. Favre attempted 51 passes -- yikes -- and the offense generated only 10 points. For that, blame Coach Brad Childress, who limited Adrian Peterson to 18 carries, at least two fewer than he should have gotten, considering Childress had Favre throw twice from the 1-foot line during the Steelers' third-quarter goal-line stand.
