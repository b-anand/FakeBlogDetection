 Since the N.F.L. went to a 12-team playoff format in 1990, 11 teams have rebounded from being at least three games under .500 after Week 5 or later to qualify for the postseason. That includes five teams that began 1-4 and ended up winning their division. So keep the faith, St. Louis, Tampa Bay, Detroit, Cleveland and Tennessee. But especially you, Kansas City. Five things we learned in Week 6, other than that New Orleans is the best team in football:

ANOTHER STRONG START FOR FAVRE Think the Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, is wondering where this Brett Favre was last year? Probably not. After all, this was the way Favre looked early last season for the Jets, before he broke down. But when Favre rifled a 58-yard pass to Sidney Rice after the Baltimore Ravens had taken a lead late in the fourth quarter Sunday, he looked like the Favre of Green Bay vintage. Favre is completely at ease running the Vikings' offense. He had only 259 yards passing in Minnesota's 33-31 victory, but the Vikings are 6-0. Things will become a lot scarier if Adrian Peterson's ankle injury and Percy Harvin's bad shoulder limit them.

STEELERS ROUNDING INTO FORM It was a very good day for the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Vikings' next opponent. They were revived by the return of safety Troy Polamalu, who had a first-half interception against Cleveland. The Steelers had 543 yards of offense, beat the Browns, 27-14, and watched Baltimore and the upstart Bengals lose, leaving the Steelers tied with Cincinnati atop the American Football Conference North at 4-2. The Bengals may have also lost defensive end Antwan Odom, who was tied for the league lead in sacks entering the day, to an Achilles' injury. And you can bet Ben Roethlisberger and Bruce Arians will smile thinking about a Vikings defense that gave up 368 passing yards to Joe Flacco.

FOR REDSKINS, IT GETS WORSE The bottom has officially dropped out from the Washington Redskins. They lost to the Chiefs on Sunday -- their third loss to a previously winless team in four weeks -- to drop to 2-4. Coach Jim Zorn, desperate to save his job, benched quarterback Jason Campbell after an ineffective first half, giving the ball to 37-year-old Todd Collins, who was sacked for a safety that sealed the Chiefs' 14-6 victory. The Redskins' offense generated 265 yards and 7 first downs against a team that had been yielding 402.8 yards per game. And the Redskins are so bereft of top-flight talent that even members of the organization were shaking their heads over the rebuilding ahead. Yes, they have a lot of injuries on the offensive line, and the team has been taking abuse from everyone from John Riggins to Sonny Jurgensen. But this is what should burn the Redskins' owner, Daniel Snyder, more than anything: FedEx Field had wide swaths of empty seats on a cold, wet Sunday. Zorn was stripped of play-calling duties after the game, and that is probably just the beginning.

SMOOTHER RIDE FOR TEXANS Last week, the Houston Texans' owner, Bob McNair, was bemoaning his team's inconsistency by rolling his hand up and down, imitating the roller coaster the Texans have been on this season. McNair thought the lack of veteran leadership was the problem. But who needs that, when he has receiver Andre Johnson? ''He's something, isn't he?'' McNair said. On Sunday, Johnson caught eight passes for 135 yards in the Texans' 28-17 upset of the Cincinnati Bengals. The Texans are now 3-3 and while they are not going to catch the Colts in the division, they could gain some ground with games against San Francisco and Buffalo before they play Indianapolis on Nov. 8.
