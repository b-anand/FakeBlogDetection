 Brett Keisel grew up idolizing Brett Favre, so he has known for years that Favre hops while he pump-fakes to draw a safety to a spot that will leave a receiver open. But that move also gives defenders another split second to get to Favre.

On Sunday, Keisel, all grown up as a defensive end for the Pittsburgh Steelers, took advantage of that extra moment to go around the edge on the Minnesota Vikings and swat the ball out of Favre’s hand late in the fourth quarter. The fumble was returned 77 yards for a touchdown by Steelers linebacker LaMarr Woodley. Less than five minutes later, another Favre turnover was returned for a long touchdown as the Steelers handed the Vikings their first loss of the season, 27-17.

“It’s one of those slow-motion moments that’s a joy in this business, depending on what end of it you’re on,” Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin said.

Somewhere, Jets fans were probably nodding their heads in recognition.

The turnover-prone version of Favre, who emerged during the Jets’ late-season collapse of 2008, had not been seen since he arrived in Minnesota. But Favre seems to be a magnet for drama. The fumble came moments after the Vikings (6-1) had a touchdown taken off the board when tight end Jeff Dugan was called for tripping. But it was nearly irrelevant because Percy Harvin returned the ensuing kickoff 88 yards for a Minnesota touchdown.

That drew the Vikings to 20-17 and set the stage for the other Favre, who specializes in late-game heroics. Indeed, this game presented the yin and yang of Favre. He had 34 completions, the second most of his career. And sure enough, Favre drove the Vikings to the Pittsburgh 26 with two minutes left.

But he then threw a lightning-fast short pass to Chester Taylor, which Minnesota Coach Brad Childress later said probably came in too hot. It bounced off Taylor’s hands and into the grasp of linebacker Keyaron Fox, who raced 82 yards for a touchdown that finally sealed the victory.

Even for a franchise built on defense, it was extraordinary. It was the first time the Steelers (5-2) had scored two defensive touchdowns in a game in almost 11 years.

The game ended, fittingly, when Favre was brought down hard by James Harrison as time ran out. For Favre, a 40-year-old quarterback who had been enjoying a turn-back-the-clock season, this was a hard jolt from reality. When he emerged from the locker room, eyes rimmed in red, he wore a knit hat pulled low over his brow.

“I would have felt a lot better had we won,” Favre said. “Physically, we knew it would be a Pittsburgh matchup.”

Favre said that the Steelers’ defense blitzed him on nearly every snap, a hallmark of a game plan by the defensive coordinator, Dick LeBeau. On the interception, Favre said, he was not sure if the Vikings could have run the play any better.

The Steelers struggled earlier in the season to close out games; their back-to-back losses to the Chicago Bears and the Cincinnati Bengals came after they held leads. Their four victories entering Sunday’s game were against teams that had combined for four victories, calling into question whether the defending Super Bowl champions had suffered a letdown. Now, they have won four straight games and are tied for first place with Cincinnati in the American Football Conference North entering their bye week.

The Vikings dominated time of possession, holding the ball for nearly 14 minutes more than the Steelers. Minnesota had 386 yards of offense and converted 50 percent of its third-down opportunities.

The Steelers’ offense was struggling for points; early in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh made it to the Vikings’ 9 before Rashard Mendenhall fumbled. It fell to the defense to take control.

The Steelers turned in a vintage goal-line stand at the 1 with six minutes left in the third quarter. That will probably be scrutinized because of Childress’s decision to have Favre pass on second and third down, instead of giving the ball to running back Adrian Peterson, who had been stuffed on first down.

“I would think you hand it to Adrian, but they did a good job of stopping him,” Favre said. “We needed to get more points in the red zone.”
