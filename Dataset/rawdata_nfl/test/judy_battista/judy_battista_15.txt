On the day after Rush Limbaugh was dumped from an ownership group hoping to buy the St. Louis Rams, he blamed everybody from the players union leader, DeMaurice Smith, to his former partner Dave Checketts for his departure. Limbaugh spent the first 15 minutes of his Thursday radio show explaining how he came to be a part of the group in the first place — and how his involvement came to an end.

Limbaugh also said that Checketts, the former Madison Square Garden executive who is spearheading the bid, assured him that he “cleared” Limbaugh’s involvement with people “at the highest levels of the N.F.L.” Limbaugh did not name the people Checketts said he had consulted. Checketts, through a spokesman, declined to comment.

Limbaugh said that Checketts first approached him at a golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., and told Limbaugh that he wanted to talk to him about the Rams, after word had leaked early this year that the team would most likely be sold. Checketts went to Limbaugh’s home in late May or early June, Limbaugh said, and made his pitch. Limbaugh said he was to be a minority partner, and that he would have had no role in running the team — although last week Limbaugh said that he and Checketts would run the team.

“I said to him at this meeting, Are you aware of the firestorm?” Limbaugh said on his show. “He said: Believe me, I wouldn’t have approached you if I hadn’t taken care of that. If I had not cleared your involvement with people at the highest levels of the National Football League. He gave me a couple of names, pretty high up. Led me to believe it was all handled. And he was fully prepared for what was going to happen.”

An N.F.L. spokesman, Greg Aiello, said: “We do not pre-approve prospective owners of N.F.L. clubs and did not do so in Mr. Limbaugh’s case. At all times we have been clear with prospective purchasers of the Rams or any other club that approval of an owner could only be granted by a vote of the 32 clubs after complete financial and personal due diligence, which obviously has not taken place here.”

When news of Limbaugh’s involvement leaked last week, Limbaugh said that he again asked Checketts if he was prepared for the controversy and that Checketts assured him he was.

But on Tuesday evening, hours after Commissioner Roger Goodell cast doubt on Limbaugh’s viability as a potential owner by saying he would not want divisive comments coming from someone in a responsible position in the N.F.L., Checketts asked Limbaugh to withdraw. “ ‘I feel terrible about this, but we can’t go forward with you in the group,’ ” Limbaugh said Checketts told him.

Then, Limbaugh said, he told Checketts he would not quit and that Checketts would have to fire him. Checketts dumped Limbaugh on Wednesday.

Limbaugh also said that the reason Smith publicly expressed his concern about Limbaugh’s involvement last weekend and the reason that Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson got involved was to fire a warning shot to owners as they enter difficult negotiations toward a new collective bargaining agreement.

A union spokesman, George Atallah, confirmed that Smith had multiple conversations with Sharpton and Jackson before they made statements Monday encouraging the N.F.L. to reject Limbaugh, but he declined to comment on Limbaugh’s allegations that Smith got involved in the Limbaugh debate as a way to send a message to owners.

“The owners are not going to admit that,” Limbaugh said. “That is one of the things that is going on behind the scenes.”

Moments later, he said the union’s actions were “designed to intimidate the owners, frighten the owners and say, ‘We’re running this league now, gang, not you.’ ”

Limbaugh concluded by saying he still loved the N.F.L. and that he had “lost nothing.” But with Limbaugh out, Checketts’s group is now looking for other investors.

Given the difficulties in obtaining credit, a winning bidder will need an enormous amount of cash, and each bid group must have a majority owner, who would have at least a 30 percent stake in the team. Checketts’s bid is still not considered a favorite in part because several owners quietly expressed concerns this week about whether he would be able to come up with enough money. There are thought to be between three and six groups bidding. One executive briefed on the bidding process said one of the strongest bids may come from a black St. Louis businessman. There are no minority owners of N.F.L. teams.

Whoever prevails— and it is not even certain that the Rosenbloom family will decide to sell — the group will face intense vetting both from the N.F.L.’s finance committee and from N.F.L. security, among others. And all of that is before owners take a vote.
