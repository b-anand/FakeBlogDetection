 The Pittsburgh Steelers' starting quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, will miss Sunday night's critical game against the Baltimore Ravens because of symptoms from the concussion he sustained last week. Roethlisberger passed concussion tests early in the week, according to Coach Mike Tomlin, and he practiced Wednesday and Thursday. But he apparently started having headaches after those practices, and he took few snaps Friday.

Dennis Dixon, who has attempted one pass in his two seasons, will start. Roethlisberger's regular backup, Charlie Batch, sustained a broken left wrist when he replaced Roethlisberger in overtime last week against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The concussion is at least the fourth of Roethlisberger's professional career, but early in the week he told the Steelers he felt fine. The Steelers chose not to pursue an experienced veteran quarterback, presumably because they expected Roethlisberger to play. Instead, they signed the former University of Pittsburgh quarterback Tyler Palko to take snaps in practice. Now, Palko will be Dixon's backup.

Roethlisberger's sturdiness is part of his legend, and his absence is a setback for the Steelers as they battle to stay in the playoff race. They are a game behind Cincinnati in the American Football Conference North, but because they have lost twice to the Bengals, the Steelers' best playoff chances may come as a wild card. The Steelers are just one game ahead of the Ravens.
