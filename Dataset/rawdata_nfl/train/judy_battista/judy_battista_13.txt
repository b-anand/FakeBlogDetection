 The Buffalo Bills fired Coach Dick Jauron on Tuesday, making him the first coaching casualty of the season.

The team's defensive coordinator, Perry Fewell, was named the interim head coach.

Fewell is in his 12th N.F.L. season, and fourth with Buffalo as the team's defensive coordinator, after being hired by Jauron. He is the team's first black head coach.

In-season coaching changes are unusual in the N.F.L. because the short season means even a new coach can have little impact. The timing of the firing is especially odd because the Bills had a bye two weeks ago, a more natural time to make a change. But they were routed, 41-17, by the three-win Tennessee Titans on Sunday to drop to 3-6.

Jauron was apparently surprised. He was called to a meeting with the team's owner, Ralph Wilson, in Detroit and fired.

''While this was a very difficult decision, I felt that it is one that needed to be made at this time for the best interest of our team,'' Wilson said. ''We will now focus on moving forward and preparing for our game this week in Jacksonville.''

It had been a rocky season for Jauron. He fired his offensive coordinator, Turk Schonert, before the first regular-season game, after Schonert spent the off-season installing a no-huddle system.

The offense has scored only 12 touchdowns and is ranked 29th in the N.F.L. Trent Edwards, the starting quarterback, has been ineffective and injured, and his backup, Ryan Fitzpatrick, has not been much better. Jauron's dismissal comes a year too late for many Bills fans, who thought he should have been fired after the Bills finished 7-9 in 2008 for the third consecutive season.
