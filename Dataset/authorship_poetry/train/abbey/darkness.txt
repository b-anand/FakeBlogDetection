 My hopes and my ambition all were down,
   Like grass the mower turneth from its place;
 The night's thick darkness was an angry frown,
   And earth a tear upon the cheek of space.

 The mighty fiend of storm in wild unrest,
   By lightning stabbed, dragged slowly up the plain;
 Great clots of light, like blood, dripped down his breast,
   And from his open jaws fell foam in rain.
