 This is his story as I gathered it;
 The simple story of a plain, true man.
 I cling with Abraham Lincoln to the fact,
 That they who make a nation truly great
 Are plain men, scattered in each walk of life.
 To them, my words. And if I cut, perchance.
 Against the rind of prejudice, and disclose
 The fruit of truth, it is for the love of truth;
 And truth, I hold with Joubert, to consist
 In seeing things and persons as God sees.
