 In passing through the grounds of Richard Wain,
 Karagwe found, upon a plat of grass,
 Some sheets of paper fastened at the ends,
 Blown from the house, he thought, or thrown away.
 The sheets were closely written on and sealed.
 Here was a long-sought opportunity
 To learn the older letters of the pen.
 That night the writings, wrapped about the Book,
 Were safe within the hollow of the tree.
