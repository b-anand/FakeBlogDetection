"It was not you I came to please,
   Only myself," flipped she;
"I like this spot of phantasies,
   And thought you far from me."
But O, he was the secret spell
   That led her to the lea!

"It was not she who shaped my ways,
   Or works, or thoughts," he said.
"I scarcely marked her living days,
   Or missed her much when dead."
But O, his joyance knew its knell
   When daisies hid her head!
