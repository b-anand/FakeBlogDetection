  I was just aiming at the jagged hole
   Torn in the yellow sandbags of their trench,
   When something threw me sideways with a wrench,
   And the skies seemed to shrivel like a scroll
   And disappear... and propped against the bole
   Of a big elm I lay, and watched the clouds
   Float through the blue, deep sky in speckless crowds,
   And I was clean again, and young, and whole.

   Lord, what a dream that was!  And what a doze
   Waiting for Bill to come along to class!
   I've cut it now -- and he --  Oh, hello, Fred!
   Why, what's the matter? -- here -- don't be an ass,
   Sit down and tell me! --  What do you suppose?
   I dreamed I... AM I... wounded?  "YOU ARE DEAD."
