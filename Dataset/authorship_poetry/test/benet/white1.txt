   Go away!

      Go away; I will not confess to you!

   His black biretta clings like a hangman's cap; under his twitching fingers
     the beads shiver and click,
   As he mumbles in his corner, the shadow deepens upon him;
   I will not confess!...

   Is he there or is it intenser shadow?
   Dark huddled coilings from the obscene depths,
   Black, formless shadow,
   Shadow.
   Doors creak; from secret parts of the chateau come the scuffle and worry
     of rats.

   Orange light drips from the guttering candles,
   Eddying over the vast embroideries of the bed
   Stirring the monstrous tapestries,
   Retreating before the sable impending gloom of the canopy
   With a swift thrust and sparkle of gold,
   Lipping my hands,
   Then
   Rippling back abashed before the ominous silences
   Like the swift turns and starts of an overpowered fencer
   Who sees before him Horror
   Behind him darkness,
   Shadow.

   The clock jars and strikes, a thin, sudden note like the sob of a child.
   Clock, buhl clock that ticked out the tortuous hours of my birth,
   Clock, evil, wizened dwarf of a clock, how many years of agony
     have you relentlessly measured,
   Yardstick of my stifling shroud?

   I am Aumaury de Montreuil; once quick, soon to be eaten of worms.
   You hear, Father?  Hsh, he is asleep in the night's cloak.

   Over me too steals sleep.
   Sleep like a white mist on the rotting paintings of cupids and gods
     on the ceiling;
   Sleep on the carven shields and knots at the foot of the bed,
   Oozing, blurring outlines, obliterating colors,
   Death.

   Father, Father, I must not sleep!
   It does not hear -- that shadow crouched in the corner...
   Is it a shadow?
   One might think so indeed, save for the calm face, yellow as wax,
     that lifts like the face of a drowned man from the choking darkness.
