   Tobacco smoke drifts up to the dim ceiling
   From half a dozen pipes and cigarettes,
   Curling in endless shapes, in blue rings wheeling,
   As formless as our talk.  Phil, drawling, bets
   Cornell will win the relay in a walk,
   While Bob and Mac discuss the Giants' chances;
   Deep in a morris-chair, Bill scowls at "Falk",
   John gives large views about the last few dances.

   And so it goes -- an idle speech and aimless,
   A few chance phrases; yet I see behind
   The empty words the gleam of a beauty tameless,
   Friendship and peace and fire to strike men blind,
   Till the whole world seems small and bright to hold --
   Of all our youth this hour is pure gold.
