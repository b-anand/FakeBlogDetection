   I shall go away
   To the brown hills, the quiet ones,
   The vast, the mountainous, the rolling,
   Sun-fired and drowsy!

   My horse snuffs delicately
   At the strange wind;
   He settles to a swinging trot; his hoofs tramp the dust.
   The road winds, straightens,
   Slashes a marsh,
   Shoulders out a bridge,
   Then --
   Again the hills.
   Unchanged, innumerable,
   Bowing huge, round backs;
   Holding secret, immense converse:
   In gusty voices,
   Fruitful, fecund, toiling
   Like yoked black oxen.

   The clouds pass like great, slow thoughts
   And vanish
   In the intense blue.

   My horse lopes; the saddle creaks and sways.
   A thousand glittering spears of sun slant from on high.
   The immensity, the spaces,
   Are like the spaces
   Between star and star.

   The hills sleep.
   If I put my hand on one,
   I would feel the vast heave of its breath.
   I would start away before it awakened
   And shook the world from its shoulders.
   A cicada's cry deepens the hot silence.
   The hills open
   To show a slope of poppies,
   Ardent, noble, heroic,
   A flare, a great flame of orange;
   Giving sleepy, brittle scent
   That stings the lungs.
   A creeping wind slips through them like a ferret; they bow and dance,
     answering Beauty's voice...

   The horse whinnies.  I dismount
   And tie him to the grey worn fence.
   I set myself against the javelins of grass and sun;
   And climb the rounded breast,
   That flows like a sea-wave.
   The summit crackles with heat, there is no shelter, no hollow from
     the flagellating glare.

   I lie down and look at the sky, shading my eyes.
   My body becomes strange, the sun takes it and changes it, it does not feel,
     it is like the body of another.
   The air blazes.  The air is diamond.
   Small noises move among the grass...

   Blackly,
   A hawk mounts, mounts in the inane
   Seeking the star-road,
   Seeking the end...
   But there is no end.

   Here, in this light, there is no end....
