  Out of the drowsy fog my body creeps back to me.
   It is the white time before dawn.
   Moonlight, watery, pellucid, lifeless, ripples over the world.
   The grass beneath it is gray; the stars pale in the sky.
   The night dew has fallen;
   An infinity of little drops, crystals from which all light has been taken,
   Glint on the sighing branches.
   All is purity, without color, without stir, without passion.

   Suddenly a peacock screams.

   My heart shocks and stops;
   Sweat, cold corpse-sweat
   Covers my rigid body.
   My hair stands on end.  I cannot stir.  I cannot speak.
   It is terror, terror that is walking the pale sick gardens
   And the eyeless face no man may see and live!
   Ah-h-h-h-h!
   Father, Father, wake! wake and save me!
   In his corner all is shadow.

   Dead things creep from the ground.
   It is so long ago that she died, so long ago!
   Dust crushes her, earth holds her, mold grips her.
   Fiends, do you not know that she is dead?...
   "Let us dance the pavon!" she said; the waxlights glittered like swords
     on the polished floor.
   Twinkling on jewelled snuffboxes, beaming savagely from the crass gold
     of candelabra,
   From the white shoulders of girls and the white powdered wigs of men...
   All life was that dance.
   The mocking, resistless current,
   The beauty, the passion, the perilous madness --
   As she took my hand, released it and spread her dresses like petals,
   Turning, swaying in beauty,
   A lily, bowed by the rain, --
   Moonlight she was, and her body of moonlight and foam,
   And her eyes stars.
   Oh the dance has a pattern!
   But the clear grace of her thrilled through the notes of the viols,
   Tremulous, pleading, escaping, immortal, untamed,
   And, as we ended,
   She blew me a kiss from her hand like a drifting white blossom --
   And the starshine was gone; and she fled like a bird up the stair.

   Underneath the window a peacock screams,
   And claws click, scrape
   Like little lacquered boots on the rough stone.

   Oh the long fantasy of the kiss; the ceaseless hunger, ceaselessly,
     divinely appeased!
   The aching presence of the beloved's beauty!
   The wisdom, the incense, the brightness!

   Once more on the ice-bright floor they danced the pavon
   But I turned to the garden and her from the lighted candles.
   Softly I trod the lush grass between the black hedges of box.
   Softly, for I should take her unawares and catch her arms,
   And embrace her, dear and startled.

   By the arbor all the moonlight flowed in silver
   And her head was on his breast.
   She did not scream or shudder
   When my sword was where her head had lain
   In the quiet moonlight;
   But turned to me with one pale hand uplifted,
   All her satins fiery with the starshine,
   Nacreous, shimmering, weeping, iridescent,
   Like the quivering plumage of a peacock...
   Then her head drooped and I gripped her hair,
   Oh soft, scented cloud across my fingers! --
   Bending her white neck back....

   Blood writhed on my hands; I trod in blood....
   Stupidly agaze
   At that crumpled heap of silk and moonlight,
   Where like twitching pinions, an arm twisted,
   Palely, and was still
   As the face of chalk.

   The buhl clock strikes.
   Thirty years.  Christ, thirty years!
   Agony.  Agony.

   Something stirs in the window,
   Shattering the moonlight.
   White wings fan.
   Father, Father!

   All its plumage fiery with the starshine,
   Nacreous, shimmering, weeping, iridescent,
   It drifts across the floor and mounts the bed,
   To the tap of little satin shoes.
   Gazing with infernal eyes.
   Its quick beak thrusting, rending, devil's crimson...
   Screams, great tortured screams shake the dark canopy.
   The light flickers, the shadow in the corner stirs;
   The wax face lifts; the eyes open.

   A thin trickle of blood worms darkly against the vast red coverlet
     and spreads to a pool on the floor.
