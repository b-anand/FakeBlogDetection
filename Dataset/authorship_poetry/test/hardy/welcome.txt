   To my native place
   Bent upon returning,
   Bosom all day burning
   To be where my race
Well were known, 'twas much with me
There to dwell in amity.

   Folk had sought their beds,
   But I hailed:  to view me
   Under the moon, out to me
   Several pushed their heads,
And to each I told my name,
Plans, and that therefrom I came.

   "Did you? . . .  Ah, 'tis true
   I once heard, back a long time,
   Here had spent his young time,
   Some such man as you . . .
Good-night."  The casement closed again,
And I was left in the frosty lane.
