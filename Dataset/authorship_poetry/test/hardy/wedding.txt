   Tabitha dressed for her wedding:-
   "Tabby, why look so sad?"
"--O I feel a great gloominess spreading, spreading,
   Instead of supremely glad! . . .

   "I called on Carry last night,
   And he came whilst I was there,
Not knowing I'd called.  So I kept out of sight,
   And I heard what he said to her:

   "'--Ah, I'd far liefer marry
   YOU, Dear, to-morrow!' he said,
'But that cannot be.'--O I'd give him to Carry,
   And willingly see them wed,

   "But how can I do it when
   His baby will soon be born?
After that I hope I may die.  And then
   She can have him.  I shall not mourn!'
