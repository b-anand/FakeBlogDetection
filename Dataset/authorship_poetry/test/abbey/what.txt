 I went out in the country
   To spend an idle day--
 To see the flowers in blossom,
   And scent the fragrant hay.

 The dawn's spears smote the mountains
   Upon their shields of blue,
 And space, in her black valleys,
   Joined in the conflict too.

 The clouds were jellied amber;
   The crickets in the grass
 Blew pipe and hammered tabor,
   And laughed to see me pass.

 The cows down in the pasture,
   The mowers in the field,
 The birds that sang in heaven,
   Their happiness revealed.

 My heart was light and joyful,
   I could not answer why;
 And I thought that it was better
   Always to smile than sigh.

 How could I hope to meet her
   Whom most I wished to meet?
 If always I had lost her,
   Then life were incomplete.

 The road ran o'er a brooklet;
   Upon the bridge she stood,
 With wild flowers in her ringlets,
   And in her hand her hood.

 The morn laid on her features
   An envious golden kiss;
 She might have fancied truly,
   I longed to share its bliss.

 I said, "O, lovely maiden,
   I have sought you many a day.
 That I love you, love you, love you,
   Is all that I can say."

 Her mournful eyes grew brighter,
   And archly glanced, though meek.
 A bacchanalian dimple
   Dipt a wine-cup in her cheek.

 "If you love me, love me, love me,
   If you love me as you say,
 You must prove it, prove it, prove it!"
   And she lightly turned away.
