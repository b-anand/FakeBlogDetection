 I never behold the sea
   Rush up to the hand of the shore,
 And with its vehement lips
   Kiss its down-dropt whiteness o'er,
 But I think of that magic night,
   When my lips, like waves on a coast,
 Broke over the moonlit hand
   Of her that I love the most.

 I never behold the surf
   Lit by the sun into gold,
 Curl and glitter and gleam,
   In a ring-like billow rolled,
 But I think of another ring,
   A simple, delicate band,
 That in the night of our troth
   I placed on a darling hand.
