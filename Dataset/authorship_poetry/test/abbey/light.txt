 At twilight, past the fountain,
   I wandered in the park,
 And saw a closed white lily
   Sway on the liquid dark;
 And a fire-fly, perched upon it,
   Shone out its fitful spark.

 I fancied it a light-house
   Mooned on a sky-like sea,
 To warn the fearless sailors
   Of lurking treachery--
 Of unseen reefs and shallows
   That starved for wrecks to be.

 O Blanche, O love that spurns me,
   'Tis but a cheat thou art.
 I would some friendly light-house
   Had warned me to depart
 From the secret reefs and shallows
   That hide about your heart.
