 She bowed, and smiled, and passed me by,
     She passed me by!
 O love, O lava breath that burns,
 'Tis hard indeed to think she spurns
   Such worshippers as you and I.
 She smiled, and bowed, with stately pride;
 The bow the frosty smile belied.
     She passed me by.

 She bowed, and smiled, and passed me by,
     She passed me by.
 What more could any maiden do?
 It did not prove she was untrue.
   My heart is tired, I know not why.
 I only know I weep and pray.
 Love has its night as well as day.
     She passed me by.
