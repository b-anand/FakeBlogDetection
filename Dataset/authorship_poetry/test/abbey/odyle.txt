We know that they are often near
   Of whom we think, of whom we talk,
 Though we have missed them many a year,
   And lost them from our daily walk.

 Some strange clairvoyance dwells in all,
   And webs the souls of human kind.
 I would that I could learn its thrall,
   And know the power of mind on mind.

 I then might quickly use the sense,
   To find where one I worship dwells,
 If in the city, or if thence
   Among the breeze-rung lily bells.
