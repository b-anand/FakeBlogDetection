Boeing filed a formal protest on Tuesday seeking to overturn the Air Force’s award of a $35 billion contract to build aerial-refueling planes to a team that includes its European rival, Airbus. It said that the military had changed specifications to accommodate the bigger Airbus plane.

The protest will tap into a heated political debate about American jobs and military competitiveness and perhaps keep the issue prominent for months.

“This competition was seriously flawed and resulted in the selection of the wrong airplane,” Mark McGraw, head of Boeing’s tanker program, said in a statement issued after the company filed its protest with the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

Michael R. Golden, an official in the G.A.O.’s contract protest office, said the filing by Boeing and subsequent filings expected from the Air Force and from Northrop Grumman, the lead contractor teamed with Airbus, would not be made public because they contained confidential cost data.

The protest could delay deliveries of the refueling tankers, which are needed by the Air Force to begin replacing a nearly 50-year-old fleet of cold war-era planes. The agency has 100 days to review the protest, after which the contract could be overturned, altered or upheld.

The value of the contract could grow to $100 billion and run for decades, making it one of the biggest recent military purchases.

Analysts agree that the Air Force changed its criteria for the tanker. The question is whether it did so improperly.

Loren B. Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, said, “It appears, over time, Northrop Grumman was able to change the Air Force’s mind about what it wanted.”

Early in the competition, Mr. Thompson said, it appeared that the Air Force wanted a tanker only, but then it embraced the notion of a more versatile plane that could haul large quantities of cargo and large numbers of soldiers and other personnel.

The winning plane is based on the Airbus A330 passenger jet, a bigger and newer plane than the Boeing 767, which was the basis for the losing tanker proposal.

“The Air Force followed a carefully structured process, designed to provide transparency, maintain integrity and promote fair competition,” the service said in a statement. “The Air Force provided all offerers with continuous feedback through discussions on the strengths and weaknesses of their proposals.”

In its statement, Boeing called the changes “frequent and often unstated.” It also said its costs had been improperly evaluated.

Both Boeing and Airbus have huge backlogs of commercial aircraft orders, so neither is in dire need of this contract. But it would help Boeing’s military business, which has not been growing as fast as its commercial plane business. It would also help keep its 767 production line going past 2012; Boeing has just 51 orders for that plane in its backlog as of Jan. 31.

For Airbus and its corporate parent, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS, the tanker deal would give it a big foothold in United States military contracting. It plans to build the tankers in Alabama and to move assembly of its commercial cargo A330 to Alabama.
